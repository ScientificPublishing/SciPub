*Acknowledgments*

This treatise culminates a journey of many years which at its inception
had a very limited objective. In 1950 I proposed to a publisher that I
write a primer based mainly on *A Texibook of Marvin Philosophy,*
prepared in the early 1930s by the Leningrad Institute of Philosophy.
The publisher agreed.

Aware that there were areas of the subject that I knew little about, I
began a course of reading that I believed would be completed in a
relatively short time. Contrary to my expectations, the more I read the
more I realized how much more there was to know. As years passed, it
seemed to family and friends that I was engaged in a mission impossible,
and that the reading and the writing were a kind of perpetual motion
without end.

This impression was reinforced by numerous protracted interruptions
neces­sitated by my work as an attorney. During the 1950s and 1960s I
represented persons attacked in the Cold War witchhunts---some in
deportation proceedings based on their affiliation with or membership in
left-wing organizations and some subpoenaed by the House Un-American
Activities Committee or the Senate Internal Security Committee. In the
1970s my focus shifted to defense of refugees. Other activities also
made considerable demands on my time. Actu­ally, these involvements were
an integral part of work on the book. They provided many opportunities
for practical testing of my formulations of the concepts of dialectical
materialism and, in turn, of correcting or deepening these formulations.

Crucial to the completion of the book was the help of my family and
their forbearance during the endless hours spent in studying and
writing, as well as the help---including indispensable technical
assistance---of friends. For many valuable criticisms and suggestions I
am particularly indebted to Bernard Seeman and Susan Warren. Linda
Briggs (who designed the book) and Susan Loves (who gave advice and
other help in the production of the book) ably helped in a laborious
undertaking. To all, my profound thanks!

My hope is that in the present period of increasing complexity,
intensifying turmoil, and accelerating tempo of events, the book\'s
comprehensive account of dialectical materialism will enable readers to
understand better---and more ef­fectively change---the world and
themselves. Above all, I hope the book will be useful for those striving
to achieve a socialist society.

> **ON THE SCOPE AND MODE OF EXPOSITION**
>
> **While imperialism\'s signs of decay multiply and deepen, many people
> who previously believed socialism to be the solution now have become
> unsure, or even hostile. Because of events in the Union of Socialist
> Soviet Republics (USSR), particularly after the mid-1950s, and of
> events in the People\'s Republic of China (PRC), particularly after
> the mid-1970s, many of those who before then had been favorably
> disposed to Marxism---Leninism---including its philoso­phy, dialectical
> materialism---now view it with skepticism regarding its truth and
> cynicism regarding its values. Buttressing this skepticism and
> cynicism, experience has falsified many prophecies made periodically
> by Marxist-Leninists that capitalism\'s collapse was imminent or at
> least not far off, and this has led many persons to conclude, on the
> contrary, that capitalism, despite manifest infirmities, is as a
> system essentially stable and endowed with pro­tracted life.**
>
> **It is the purpose of this book to expound the concepts of
> dialectical mate­rialism as a science, and at the very end of the book,
> in an addendum, to try to apply these concepts to explain the
> unsettling developments in the socialist world as basically a
> law-governed process, and to delimit this process\' further overall
> course.**
>
> **The book is intended to provide a comprehensive and coherent account
> of dialectical materialism. Included are the laws and categories
> present in all things and processes\* at all times, and other laws and

> classes---provides a synthesis for the book as a whole.**

> Tracing the origins and development of concepts of dialectics is vital
> for their comprehension, yet most expositions of dialectical
> materialism do not treat its aspects fully historically---in terms of
> the main stages in the history of philosophic cognition:
> prescientific,\* scientific, and antiscientific stages. The stages are
> not rigid pigeonholes but at best approximate and reflect innumerable
> advances and regressions in the discernment---however partial,
> imprecise, and uncoordinated---of aspects of scientific philosophy.
> More concretely, the prescientific stage is a sum, a complex of
> subsidiary levels in which the nonscientific is predominant but is
> intermingled with scientific and antiscientific formulations of very
> general aspects of nature, society, and thought.
>
> In this book the exposition of each aspect of dialectical materialism
> is divided into prescientific (including data from preclass and class
> society and from the development of thought in the child, especially
> in the research done by Jean Piaget and his colleagues); scientific
> (including data from the natural sciences and selections from Hegel,
> Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Mao); and antiscientific (including
> selections from Sidney Hook, Karl Popper, Herbert Marcuse, Soren
> Kierkegaard, Jean-Paul Sartre, Ludwig Wittgenstein, Erich Fromm, Karl
> Jas­pers, Gabriel Marcel, Burrhus F. Skinner, Paul Tillich, and **J.**
> Khrishnamurti).\*\* Based on the book as a whole, readers can judge
> for themselves the accuracy and relevancy of this three-stage
> classification.
>
> **In** addition, an effort is made to integrate each of these stages
> with data from historical materialism so as to illuminate the
> interrelationship between the evo­lution of the concepts relevant to
> dialectical materialism, on the one hand, and of the level of
> technology and of the society\'s mode of production, on the other. Two
> prime sources of data regarding the prescientific stage are child
> mental development (►which illuminates the development of primitive
> cognition, only meager records of which arc now extant) and recorded
> social history. At a certain level of development (about seven to ten
> Years), child cognition con­verges with the level shown in early
> societal records, such as pre-Socratic physics, and data on this
> convergence is cited.

*Preface*

This preface and the first two chapters (\"Workers and Scientific
Philosophy\" and \"The Main Stages of Philosophical Development\") are
to be taken together as constituting the book\'s introduction to
dialectical materialism. Philosophy is so troubled a subject that this
varied and somewhat lengthy introduction is provided to help clarify and
resolve certain threshold problems (including pre­liminarily validating
the historical mode of exposition) and thereby place dialec­tical
materialism in a more precise focus before undertaking its elaboration.

**POPULAR VIEWS OF PHILOSOPHERS AND PHILOSOPHY, PAST AND PRESENT**

Public esteem for philosophers has varied widely. For a long time, many
have regarded Confucious, the Buddha, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle
with con­siderable respect, even with awe, as embodiments of wisdom and
nobility of character. Often quoted arc the words of Socrates, a martyr
to philosophy, who compared himself to a gadfly \"rousing and exhorting
and reproaching\" his fellow citizens, and who warned that if they
rashly put him to death, they would \"not easily find anyone else\" to
fill his place.\'

Another viewpoint depicts philosophers, especially professional
philoso­phers, with derision. They are seen as impractical in their
search for profun­dity---as in the much-relished legend of Thales who,
preoccupied with star­gazing, fell into a well. They have also been seen
as imposters and poseurs, pretending to be profound---as in the gibes of
the Romans: \"Be silent and you will pass as a philosopher,\" or \"
\`This man is a philosopher.\' Why?\"He wears a cloak and long hair.\'\"
Or they have been viewed as mere windbags with scant knowledge of
scientific facts---as in the retort of Lord Rutherford, the noted
physicist, to the English philosopher Samuel Alexander: \"What is it
that you have been saying all your life, Alexander? Hot air. Nothing but
hot air!\'\" For still others, philosophers are a dreary lot---as in the
colloquy between the distin­guished writer Samuel Johnson and Oliver
Edwards, when the latter confessed to an inability to emulate him: \"You
arc a philosopher, Dr. Johnson. I have tried too in my time to be a
philosopher; but, 1 don\'t know how, cheerfulness was always breaking
in.\"^4^ The poet Heine mocked philosophers as duffers: \"With

\*By the sixteenth century, philosophers had earned a spectrum of
epithets: \". . . among the commonfolk to call anyone a philosopher is
tantamount to insulting him as a quack, a good-for-nothing, a howling
pedant, a charlatan, a mountebank, a mere cheat, good only as
entertainment at home and as scarecrow in the fields\" (Giordano Bruno,
*Cause, Principle and Unity,* pp. 63-64).

**INTRODUCTION**

**CHAPTER 1.**

*Workers and Scientific Philosophy\**

**WHY WORKERS SHOULD LEARN SCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY**

**Everyone with the power of thought, however uncultivated, has a
world-view, some curiosity and some intimation about totality. No
thinking person is a philosophic vacuum. For this world-view to be
scientific, comprehension of dialectical materialism is indispensible.**

**Scientific philosophy (dialectical materialism; Marxist philosophy) is
a branch of knowledge that includes the most comprehensive general
truths of the cos­mos, the uniformities present in all things, in all
processes, at all times---the totality of universality. As a composite,
these truths constitute a scientific world-view of nature, society, and
thought.**

**Why should workers---including those in capitalist lands, as well as
those in dependent/neocolonial countries---learn scientific philosophy?
First and fore­most, because it is profound, extremely useful truth,
necessary for winning both daily and long-range struggles. For example,
knowledge of the very gen­eral truth that all things are interconnected
and changing, that nothing is com­pletely isolated and fixed, is a
necessary tool for the scientific method of examining things. Those who
view things as isolated and fixed are prepro­grammed to commit errors,
and this vulnerability will continue until this gen­eral, underlying
source of error in their mode of thought is uprooted. As Giordano Bruno
noted, \"If the first button of a man\'s coat is wrongly buttoned, all
the rest will be crooked.\"\'**

**Equally, unscientific philosophy\*\* is vital for the bourgeoisie.
Capitalists have two kinds of property---material and spiritual:
ownership not only of the state, of the means of production, and of a
worker\'s hands, but also of his mind. \"The tradition of all the dead
generations weighs like a nightmare on the brain of the living.\"\'
(Marx) Scientific philosophy helps ferret out and dissipate the
oppressive mental carryovers of age-old exploitive rule. Workers\'
knowledge of**

**\*In focusing at the outset on workers, the intent is not to exclude
others from scientific philoso­phy, but rather only to emphasize the
importance and feasibility of the inclusion of workers, who are so often
excluded.**

**\*\*Unscientific (that is, prescientific or antiscientific) and
scientific philosophy are contrasting technical terms as precise as, for
example, alchemy and chemistry. Like chemistry, which after a struggle
consigned alchemy to a museum of antiquities, scientific philosophy will
eventually dis­place unscientific philosophy as the prevailing world
outlook and then can be known simply as philosophy.**

> scientific philosophy radically weakens capitalist control of the mind
> and, in turn, of the hands without which capitalism cannot long
> continue. The antago­nism in class society between hand and brain
> coincides with that between ruled and ruler. Long ago, Chinese

> philosophers\"\' and declared that \"philosophy is impossible among
> the common people,\"\' the baseborn---the slaves, artisans, and others
> performing slave society\'s productive labor, as well as the
> merchants. The conqueror Alexander of Macedon reproached his tutor,
> Aristotle, for publishing his philosophic writings, which enabled

> Aristotle disclosed an oath by the oligarchs ruling certain cities:

> oaths the opposite of those which they now take . . . in the form of
> their oath there should be an express declaration-1 will do no wrong

**indeed, of all Nazi programs, civil and military, domestic and
foreign---is to be found in their \'struggle for the worker\'s soul.\'
\"\"**

**Most workers, if told \"love your employer,\" would ridicule and
reject this advice because they are well aware that there is an
antagonism of interests between themselves and their employers. Yet many
unknowingly adhere to the capitalist-dictated, overall mode of thought
which helps the employer to snatch his profits from workers\' labor. As
long as workers arc unaware of this philosophic entanglement, they
cannot escape it. No jail is more secure than one whose very existence
is unknown to its inmates. \"If,\" however, \"I know that I know little,
I shall strive to learn more. . . .\" (Lenin) Mental malnutrition and
undernourishment are the necessary consequences of the bourgeois mode of
thought, which secs mainly the surface and overlooks much of the deeper,
inner fullness of things. \"If people cat with a spoon that leaks half
its contents be­tween bowl and lip, arc they not likely to go hungry?\"
(Bellamy) This question answers itself. For the mass of workers---and
for scientists, writers, artists, and others who identify themselves
with the workers\' cause---insights into the pro­found is vital. The
hands of workers cannot be completely or permanently untied while their
minds remain bound.**

**Workers reject much bourgeois philosophy as trash. But those who go
further and reject all philosophy---even scientific philosophy---\"are
slaves to precisely the worst vulgarized relics of the worst
philosophers.\" (Engels) Unaware of scientific philosophy, their
comprehension and actions tend to be almost en­tirely confined to the
superficially practical, to narrow day-today perspectives, causing them
to continually stumble as life\'s larger vistas suddenly emerge from
obscurity. \"The practical man is always looking down at his feet so as
not to fall into some trap. He is very careful to guard himself against
petty failures . . . but . . . loses all control over the general
direction of his life. . . .\"\" (Pisarev)**

**Common sense, an elementary level of realism useful in many relatively
simple everyday affairs, exceeds its range of validity when elevated to
an over­all, world outlook, a philosophy. In that context, to some extent
\"common sense is what has trickled down from the science, philosophy,
art, and religion of yesterday to the level of common
misunderstanding.\" (Kaufmann)**

**Joseph Dietzgen (whom Karl Marx singled out as \"our
worker-philosopher\"), a defender of the Haymarket martyrs and a
popularizer in the United States of scientific philosophy, long ago
advised:**

> Manual laborers do not sufficiently appreciate the real value of
> mental labor. Their healthy distrust against the leading scribblers of
> bourgeois society\' leads them too far. They see how much wrong-doing
> is going on under the cloak of intellectual work and arc therefore
> inclined to undervalue mental labor and to overestimate manual labor.

> superiority, was always the prerogative of the working classes. But in
> default of mental training they have so far been outwitted. The
> emancipation of the working classes requires that they should lay hold

chants had its philosophical counterpart: Scottish common-sense realism,
a popular philosophy of the ousted British rulers. Commencing in the
1780s, courses to train professional philosophers were introduced in
colleges. \"Despite the multitude of sects, the Scottish common-sense
philosophy introduced at the end of the eighteenth century at Princeton
by President Witherspoon spread until it formed almost the sole basis of
philosophic instruction. . . . It did not rely upon subtle arguments,
but appealed to established beliefs. It could easily be reconciled with
the most literal interpretation of the Bible and could thus be used as a
club against freethinkers.\"\" (M. R. Cohen)

For the untutored mass of people and even for many of the
university-trained few, education in philosophy seemed to be a frill.
Youthful capitalism mainly posed acute but resolvable problems of
growth, not theoretical, systemic chal­lenges. In the 1830s, de
Tocqueville began his classic study on *Democracy in America* by
referring to the \"Philosophical Method of the Americans\": \"I think
that in no country in the civilized world is less attention paid to
philosophy than in the United States.\" He noted the principal
characteristic of their philosoph­ical method: \"in most of the
operations of the mind each American appeals only to the individual
effort of his own understanding.\"

Referring to the 1880s, John Dewey observed that \"teachers of
philosophy were at that time, almost to a man, clergymen; the supposed
requirements of religion, or theology, dominated the teaching of
philosophy in most col­leges. . . . It \[the teaching of philosophy\] has
been so allied with theology and theological morals as representative of
men\'s chief interests, that radical altera­tion has been shocking.\"\"

As to why academic philosophy remained so long mired in theology, Mor­ris
R. Cohen, writing in the 1950s, declared: \"hostility of the social and
eco­nomic milieu \[in the main a euphemism for ruling-class interests\]
to intellectual enterprise may be regarded as an important factor which
contributed to the subordination of philosophy either to practical
pursuits or to practical religious consolation. But whatever the causes,
the fact can hardly be disputed that American philosophy has, in large
part, been a branch of Christian apologetics. Though living in a
political democracy our clerical philosophers were the cour­tiers of a
celestial monarchy. . . .\"^16^ Expressive of this persisting
orientation is the \"widespread assumption in the United States that an
avowed atheist is *eo ipso* no philosopher.\"\" (Kaufmann)

The fact that other-worldliness is so firmly anchored in ruling-class
interests (bourgeois as well as slaveholder) is also the reason why no
\"really significant influence on American academic philosophy \[was\]
exercised by our colonial organization, by the Revolutionary War, by the
slavery struggle, by the Civil War, by our unprecedented immigration, or
by the open frontier life. . . .\"\" The predominance of theology, of
apologetics rationalizing the status quo, helps explain the ambivalence
on slavery, evident in \"the fact that, excepting some passages in John
C. Calhoun, none of our important philosophic writings men­tions the
existence of slavery or of the Negro race, \[and\] that liberal
democratic philosophers like Jefferson \[author of the Declaration of
Independence and

**varied places can help reconstruct a history of the strivings in the
United States for a people\'s history of philosophy.**

**Without minimizing the role of farmers, artisans, and others doing
produc­tive labor in their own enterprises, especially in the colonial
period, the major portion of this country\'s economic growth has
depended on wage and slave labor and on scmifeudal peonage. For some
immigrants there was upward mobility (especially for their children)
into petty-bourgeois and bourgeois ranks. But for the mass of Blacks,
Native Americans, Chicanos, and Asians, class and national
oppression---and their struggles against it---have never ceased.**

**In much of the literature, folk-sayings, songs, and struggles of these
minorities and of workers generally, explicitly as well as implicitly
expressed, one finds overall viewpoints on society, human life, and
modes of thought. Illiteracy is an impediment, but not a total bar to
profundity. Though \"with rare exceptions . . . the study of philosophy
in the United States has always been an academic pursuit,\" (I-I. M.
Jones) there have always been self-educated philosophers who were to
some extent materialist and dialectical in their orien­tation. Whether
scientific or otherwise, \"thoughts and ideas and arguments of
philosophical import have played their part in shaping and directing the
course of American history from its beginnings.\"\' (Werkmcister)**

**Through the writings of the people\'s poet, Walt Whitman, materialism
and dialectics had a significant influence on democratic movements. In**
*Leaves of Grass,* **Whitman proclaims: \"I accept Reality and dare not
question it,/ Mate­rialism first and last imbuing./ Hurrah for positive
science! Long live exact demonstration!\"\" But it is in Whitman\'s
commentary\* on Flegel\'s dialectics that the poet shows his profound
intellectual depth and discloses the impact of dialectics on his
thinking:**

> **The most profound theme that can occupy the mind of man---the
> problem on whose solution science, art, the bases and pursuits of
> nations, and every­thing else, including intelligent human happiness .

**Hegel\'s concepts of totality, of self-movement through the conflict
of opposites, provided a framework and rationale for Whitman\'s
\"fusing,\" his** *\"en masse,\"* **and for acceptance of the
inseparability of opposite forces as the norm: \"Above all, it
\[Hegel\'s approach\] provided a pattern in which conflict could be

*The Main Stages of Philosophical Development\**

**PRESCIENTIFIC PHILOSOPHY**

The philosopher Hegel termed philosophy the *\"thinking study of
things,\"\'* the insights of thought which disclose the inner nature of
things. This \"thinking study\" is two-pronged: the constructive
processes of the intellect (the concep­tual) and those of the emotions
(the affective). The intellect attains ever more comprehensive logical
powers, while the emotions orient toward systems of values.

IN\'hether or not philosophy begins in \"wonder\" (Aristotle)= or in
\"doubt\" (lliderot)\'---or to some extent in both---the origins of
\"thinking study\" go back w very remote times, far beyond the
beginnings of recorded history. This thinking interacts with
accumulating technology and culture, probing directly when able---and
imagining when not---the features of a deeper, hidden reality underlying
the immediately visible, the apparent. To equate the beginning of
civilization with the advent of slavery, as some sociologists do, is
somewhat arbitrary. \". . . in temperament and in capacity for logical
and symbolical thought, there is no difference between civilized and
primitive man.\"^4^ (Radin) Primitive peoples had their outstanding
thinkers who grappled with fundamen­tal general questions and grasped
certain rudiments of scientific philosophy, such as comprehending many
things objectively, their dynamism and intercon­nections.\' (Radin)
Philosophy, as wisdom, occupied a respected place in prc-class,
primitive conmunal (clan, gentile) society. In that society the wise
man---who was both thinker and doer---was highly regarded as the
embodiment and guardian of the collective\'s wisdom. \"The philosophy of
every epoch, since it is a definite sphere in the division of labor, has
as its presupposition certain definite intellectual material handed down
to it by its predecessors, from which it takes start. \"^6^ (Engels) The
history of philosophy has an inner logic, and this history \"is not a
blind collection of fanciful ideas, nor a fortuitous progression . . .
but represents the necessary succession of stages in the development of
this science. . .\"\" (Hegel)

Periodic advances in social practice provided a considerable supply of
infor­mation ranging from raw, simple data to more comprehensive facts to
be ana-

**scientific advance is inquiry regarding the place of humans in the
overall scheme of things.**

**Philosophy has levels of generality, extending from the very
general---the sphere of philosophy as such---to lesser levels of
generality, for example, the philosophies of physics, chemistry, and
other special sciences, including eco­nomics and politics, as well as the
philosophies of the arts, of branches of technology, and of various
occupations.**

**Hegel made a fundamental advance toward this scientific goal,

*Scientific Philosophy and Scientific Criteria*

> Scientific philosophy adheres to criteria of science---it is an
> objectively de­rived, consistent, coherent body of knowledge,
> possessing its own categories, laws, and methods; and it has
> verifiability, predictive power, and nondogmatic finality. The tests
> of truth are not limited to those often used in the physical sciences,
> i.e., to controlled, observable experiments in a laboratory. As Marx
> noted in his preface to *Capital,* \"neither microscopes nor chemical
> reagents are of use\" in the study of non-observablcs.\" Here, the
> mind\'s powers of abstrac­tion and concretization, of analysis and
> synthesis, which culminate in theory and practice must supplement
> physical methods of investigation. The various modes of apprehending
> facts necessarily correspond to the nature of the facts to be
> apprehended. The power of thought to verify scientific philosophy\'s
> asserted truths is as real and substantial as the powers of the hands
> and senses to conduct tangible tests in the physical sciences.
>
> Similarly, the predictive powers of scientific philosophy and of the
> special sciences arc inseparable, a mutually dependent function of
> each. Just as special truths cannot exist apart from general truths,
> so equally the predictive powers of the special sciences become
> drastically circumscribed and distorted when severed from scientific
> philosophy. Very general philosophic aspects, which are commonly taken
> for granted or covertly incorporated, pervade the special sci­ences.
> Without these generalities, physics, chemistry, etc., would cease to
> be sciences. True, some \"natural scientists believe that they free
> themselves from philosophy by ignoring it or abusing it. They cannot,
> however, make any headway without thought, and for thought they need
> thought determina­tions.\"\" (Engels) Scientific philosophy is both

*Existentialism\'s Social Diagnosis*

> existentialism is basically a trend of a middle class with waning
> confidence in capitalism, but still hostile to socialism. Thus Sartre,
> in opposition to Auguste Comte\'s positivism of a century earlier,
> declared: \"We do not believe in progress.\"
>
> This philosophy has both a social and a philosophical thrust against

> though they try **CO** attain it in very different ways. What all
> philosophers of Existence oppose is the \'rational\' system of thought

> Capitalism\'s demise is seen as the end of society as such, the end of

basis for science: Walt Whitman gave popular expression to this
viewpoint when he proclaimed: \"I accept Reality• and dare not question
it,/Materialism first and last imbuing.\"\'

In its philosophic context, idealism represents the opposite viewpoint
that consciousness is primary and the external world dependent. There
are profound reasons for idealism\'s persistence during the millennia of
class society. It is deeply and widely rooted in class society\'s
material conditions of life and cannot be overcome simply by ridicule.

Philosophy\'s starting point is the philosophy of antiquity, one major
compo­nent of which is \"primitive, natural materialism.\'\" In the
overall, thought moves from this comparatively limited level of
materialism---via a period of the dominance of idealism---to a profound
materialism, dialectical materialism.

This chapter on materialism and idealism covers certain threshold and
very general features of a scientific approach to reality. These
features are differ­entiated from other very general features discussed
in subsequent chapters on dialectics. In endeavoring to elaborate a
totality of very general features of reality, scientific exposition can
begin with materialism as the gateway to there­after comprehending
things/processes in their depth, their dialectical aspects---the
perusal, urged by Galileo, of \"that great book that lies before our
eyes---I mean the universe.\"\'

**PRESCIENTIFIC VIEWS\*\***

*Child Development*

Goethe\'s \"at the beginning was the deed\" is as true for the
child\*\*\* as for humanity\'s childhood. Actions, random or intended,
mark the genesis of knowledge in the child and in human beginnings:
\"life involves before every­thing else eating and drinking, a
habitation, clothing and many other things. The first historical act is
thus the production of the means to satisfy these needs, the production
of material life itself.\"\' (Marx and Engels) Similarly, an infant\'s
reflection begins with actions, especially those satisfying elementary
needs. Starting from the instinctual, there is a \"progressive
objectifying of the universe in its relations to the activity of the
hands.\"\"\*\*\*\* Thus a child\'s concepts of space arise through
actions which become internalized as insights into the con­nections among
things in a continual alternation and interaction between reflect­ing and
responding. Actions nourish mental life, leading to \"indirect
interaction between subject and object, which takes effect at ever
increasing spatio-temporal distances and along ever more complex
paths.\'\'

\*Primitive natural materialism will be referred to as primitive
materialism. The other major component of the philosophy of antiquity is
naive dialectics.

Mountains, rivers, plants, animals, the sun, the moon, and all else are
believed to be made for human benefit. Appropriately summoned and, if
necessary, propitiated, the beings inhabiting these objects make them
serve human purposes.**

***Preclass Society***

**The actions of the hand nourish the mind; the \"hand is the cutting
edge of the mind.\"\" (Bronowski) Toolmaking, the basic step with which
labor begins, is a prime manifestation of objectivity, utilizing nature
to satisfy human needs. There is evidence that man\'s \"evolving hand
and thumb, his front-focusing eyes, his upright posture and his larger
brain had, together, made him a tool­maker. . .\"21\***

**This toolmaking antedated man as such: \"The origin of humanoid
toolmaking has been pushed back to a creature who was not yet human
within any accept­able scale of brain size. . . .\" In a key sense the
origins of toolmaking, of labor, arc the origins of man, of the
transition from humanoid to human. \". . . labor created man
himself.\"\" (Engels) The pebble tools found at Olduvai Gorge in Africa
indicate that this labor process of man and his manlike progenitors,
however incipient and inchoate, was under way some two million years
ago. The charcoal in the hearths at Zhoukoudian (Choukoutien), China,
shows that fire was in use some 500,000 years ago: \"the life of Peking
Man was already structured in time, artificially and culturally, across
long seasonal periods and within shorter diurnal periods.\"**

**More than 200,000 years have elapsed since hunters \"used at least 26
tool types, including hand axes, cleavers, picks, borers, scrapers,
knives and points\*\* . . . cultures of the Upper Paleolithic periods
showed a rapid expansion in their tool kit, 93 types of chipped stone
tools being classified, apart from *a* large and diversified kit of bone
tools.\"\" There survive from the Upper Paleolithic not only the
hunter\'s artifacts but also art, symbols, and notations (such as
markings carved on bones found in widely dispersed places) which
correspond to a lunar calendar with its lunar phases. \"The art,
symbols, and notations, therefore, imply a structure, continuity, and
periodicity in the eco­nomic and cultural life of the Upper Paleolithic
hunter. . . . Though in the Upper Paleolithic explanations were by story
and via image and symbol, there was a high intelligence, cognition,
rationality, knowledge, and technical skill involved.\"**

**Storytelling was an age-old method of transmitting the knowledge of
prior generations: \"Every process recognized and used in human culture
becomes a story, and every story is an event which includes characters
(whether spirit, god, hero, person, \'mum,\' or, in modern terms,
element, particle, force, or law) who change or do things in time.\" The

This description strikingly resembles an ancient Chinese one. Chuang Tzu
(who lived c. 290 BC) wrote: \"When the Great Virtue lost its
togetherness, men\'s lives were frustrated. 1\\hen there was a general
rush for \'knowledge,\'\" men\'s covetousness outran their possessions.
Then the next thing was to invent axes and saws, to kill by laws and
statutes set up like carpenters\' measuring-lines, to disfigure by
hammers and gouges. The world seethed with discon­tent. . .\"\" (Needham)

**DIALECTICS**

SECTION 1.

Dialectics of the Object: Very General Aspects of All Things (Including
Consciousness)

> A. **LAWS OF DIALECTICS OF THE OBJECT**

**CHAPTER** 4.

*Introduction to Laws of Dialectics of the Object*

> In ancient Greece, dialectics referred to seeking truth in
> conversation---the etymology of dialectics is \"to talk between\"---by
> posing opposite ideas and logically examining their consequences. In
> bourgeois usage, dialectics fre­quently means deceptive modes of
> argument, a sophistry designed to \"prove\" the true to be false and
> the false to be true.
>
> In scientific philosophy, dialectics refers to very general truths
> derived from an objective, materialist approach to the external world:
> (1) aspects possessed by all things---in nature, society, and ,human
> consciousness; and also (2) aspects limited to but ever-present in the
> functioning of consciousness at a rational, scientific level. In this
> book the universal aspects---the dialectics of the object---are
> presented first. Those aspects present only in consciousness (at a
> rational, scientific level), the instrument of knowledge---the
> dialects of the subject---are elaborated later.
>
> On the basis of a materialist world outlook in which the external
> world is deemed primary and consciousness of things is secondary,
> derivative, cognition in the course of practice eventually passes from
> the superficial to the disclosure of profound, very general,
> dialectical aspects of the external world and of con­sciousness. This
> process begins in childhood: \"Adaptation to new realities, before
> achieving the relationships essential between subject and object,
> always starts from the surface, both of the ego (egocentrism) and of
> the objects (imita­tion).\"\' (Piaget) In both spheres the choice
> between the relatively superficial and the relatively more profound is
> an endless process that continues throughout the life of the adult:
>
> the general law . . . is that cognizance proceeds from the periphery
> to the center. . . . Thus cognizance, starting from the periphery
> (goals and results) moves in the direction of the central regions of
> the action in order to reach its internal mechanism: recognition of
> the means employed, reasons for their selection or their modification
> en route, and the like. . . .^2^ (Piaget)
>
> Dialectics is counterposed to metaphysics, a term derived from the
> Greek words *meta* (after or beyond) and *physika* (relating to
> nature, physis). Unlike his writings on nature, Aristotle\'s
> philosophic works were found only after his death. In compiling them,
> Andronicus of Rhodes placed the philosophic works after *(meta)* those
> on nature *(physika)* and entitled them \"metaphysics.\" Since then,
> the term metaphysical has been widely used to mean *beyond* the
> physical, i.e., beyond the sensory (the conceptual level) or beyond
> the objective (the spirit world).

**90 DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM**

**Metaphysics has also acquired a concrete philosophical meaning. In
scientific philsophy, metaphysics is the antithesis of dialectics. At
each step in the efforts of a materialist to grasp more of the
object---especially^,^ its inner, very general aspects---the road forks,
presenting a choice between a dialectical road forward to greater
profundity and a metaphysical one that veers toward superficiality and
away from further advance. Each step forward in dialectical knowledge is
made only by further vanquishing metaphysics.**

**Dialectical materialism is the fully, profoundly objective, completely
mate­rialist overall approach to the external world, the striving to
comprehend the totality, the whole object---both its inner and outer
aspects. Metaphysical mate­rialism---a crude, *incomplete* materialism
which tends to mistake the merely outer aspects for the whole
object---is only partly objective, thus partly idealist and partly
materialist, an inconsistent materialism. *For materialism to be
consist­ent, complete, fully scientific, it must be dialectical.***

> In primitive communal society, \"kinship is the primitive form of all

**In his philosophic poem \"\'l\'he Way of Truth and the Way of
Belief,\" Par-menides affirmed that \"being is, nonbeing is not\" and,
correlatively, that \"all things are, none change.\"\* Aristotle agreed:
\"In general, it is absurd to present the fact that familiar objects
appear to change and never to remain in the same state as a criterion of
truth. For in the pursuit of truth one must start from whatever is
always in the same state and does not undergo change.\"86\*\* Zeno\'s
paradox on the arrow in flight, yet unable to move, dramatized
Parmcnides\' views on the unreality of motion.\*\*\***

\*(:orgies, Zeno\'s pupil, pointed out that eternal being has no
existence. Thus being and nothing are identical, a reduction of
Parmenides\' thesis to absurdity.

\"Aristotle\'s formal logic is based on these principles of isolation
and fixity: (I) identity (all A is A; whatever is, is); (2)
contradiction (nothing is both A and non-A, nothing can both be and not
be); (3) excluded middle (a thing is either A or non-A; everything must
either be or not be).

From sameness and difference to connection and change, to external
change and internal change, to internal change and non-change
(self-movement and identity), i.e., contradiction---this series of
logical steps is here suggested as desirable and practicable for an
adult to take in a transition from understanding the commonplace to a
more profound comprehension of things, of the unity and conflict of
opposites. Knowledge is deepened, passing from perception of
superficial, random difference to insight into essential, necessary
difference---the *conflict* of opposites. Similarly, cognition of casual
sameness is deepened to essential, necessary sameness---the *unity* of
opposites. In dialectical logic \"the relations ( = transitions =
contradictions) of notions (ideas, concepts\] = the main content of
logic by *vthicb* these concepts (and their relations, transitions,

used to designate dialectical contradiction, and the term
\"consistency\" to refer to logical consistency.

and deception by oppressors and their military henchmen lead to

it is an instinct, then *all,* presumably, arc subject to it, making
incomprehensible both the perpetuation of the species up to this point
and the reason why only members of an oppressed class are engaged in
self-destruction. Clearly, N.larcuse has in mind a special kind of
instinct that affects only the oppressed and not the oppressors, who
evidently have an opposite \"life instinct\"---i.e., to live at the
expense of the oppressed. This death instinct is moreover a selective
one even for the oppressed class, since some of them are required to
continue living; for if the entire class were killed, the oppressors
would have to modify their lifelong \"instinct\" to live off the labor
of others and would have to go to work.

Negation of Negation*

*Meanings of Negation: Verbal Denial, Alecbanical Negation,\
and Dialectical Negation*

> **In its literal everyday meaning of \"saying no,\" negation means
> denial, e.g., rejecting the truth of a statement. To alternately say
> \"yes\" and \"no\" regarding the nature of the same thing---that a
> daisy is and is not a daisy---is mere word play divorced from
> development, a verbal negation that results in confusion and does not
> add an iota to knowledge.**
>
> **The term \"negation\" is also used to describe very general modes of
> change in things. To say that a living thing---such as a plant or an
> animal---is \"negated\" usually indicates that it ceases to exist,
> that its development is terminated. Frequently the demise of an entity
> occurs under conditions precluding its repro­duction. To kill a young
> plant by uprooting it, a larva by stepping on it, a species by
> extirpating it through hostile conditions, or a civilization by
> an­nihilating it (for instance, the burying of Pompeii by the eruption
> of Mount Vesuvius; the razing of Carthage by the Romans; and the
> extermination of certain African and Indian tribes by
> capitalists)---each is simply a destruction, a dead end. This mode of
> passing-out-of-being, which forecloses a thing\'s further development,
> is termed mechanical negation.**
>
> **This concept of \"negation has its origins in the most primitive
> forms of behavior: a baby can put an object in front of himself, then
> push it away; when he starts to talk, he is able to say \'no\' before
> he says \'yes.\' \"\' (Piaget and Inhelder) In the child\'s learning
> to say \"yes,\" mechanical negation becomes correlated with a similar
> level of affirmation: \"In effect the capacity of coordinating the
> schemata \[mental constructs, including goal and obstacles\] involves
> that of con­trasting them or of feeling them to be incompatible.
> Affirmation presupposes the power of negation. . . .\"\' (Piaget)**

> **Everyday experience shows that mechanical negation is not the only
> mode of change. Many things, favored by material conditions, give
> birth to successors and thereby assure the continued survival and

. . .\"\" (Engels)

The question that the myriad of sequential changes posed to the ancients
was what, if any, was the overall course of change, the connection
between these changes. The *Book of Changes (I Ching,* c. **1100** BC),
depicted ruling-class power as continuing under a succession of rulers
in an endless negative-positive, cyclic process: \"When decadence and
overthrow have completed their work at one end, re-integration commences
at the other, and hence this is followed by *fit* (meaning return). . .
.\"^47^

Aristotle singled out the cyclical character of development, and deemed
it to be circular: \"It follows that the coming-to-be of anything, if it
is absolutely

necessary, must be cycliell It is in circular movement, therefore, and
in\
cyclical coming-to-be that the absolutely necessary is to be found.\"\"

Cycles of development arc very common, but the question remains whether
they are circular, a complete return to a previous beginning. There is
also the opposite question: if development involves a succession of
qualitatively different states, of negations, is there any very general
linkage between some of these states, some aspects of a spiral?

In the plant world, development from sccd A to plant 13 to sccd C is an
everyday occurrence. Seed C involves a return to certain similarities of
seed A\'s form. From a superficial point of view, one that does not
search beneath appear­ances, seeds A and C arc simply alike, a completely
circular process. Actually, sccd C\'s nature, its content, embodies the
course of development from A to C, and is not identical to A. An overall
aspect of the relationship between these three successive qualitative
states is that the first and third arc somewhat differ­ent in content and
very much alike in form. Notably, also, in the intermediate state B,
there is both a breakdown of seed form A and a reconstitution of seed
form C. In negation of negation there is at a higher stage \"a
repetition . . . of certain features and properties of the lower . . . a
return as it were to the old.\" (Lenin)

Negation of negation illuminates certain very general relationships of
form and content in successive qualitative stages of a thing\'s
development. Negation of negation is a law describing very general
connections between certain stages in a thing\'s development, but is not
a law requiring development to continue.

Development does have a cyclical aspect but, contrary to Aristotle, it
is not simply circular, the repetition of completely equivalent states.
Development does involve a succession of qualitative states, of
negations; but, contrary to the mechanist view, a very general
connection exists between certain successive states (not simply any
two), the negation of negation, a sameness as well as a difference.

In modern communism, society returns to some features of primitive
commu­nism\'s forms, but on the basis of the new content (technology,
etc.) of the intervening period of class society.\* Class society\'s
private property in the

\*One of the many specific ways in which this return to certain forms of
primitive communal society is reflected is in the word \"comrade.\" In
that stage of society in India the word meant chat \"those who cat
together from the same plate arc friends\" (Chattopadllyaya, *Lokayata:
A Study in Ancient Indian Materialism,* **p.** 541).

During World War 1, the Brest-Litovsk Treaty between the Soviet Union
and German imperialism, ceding Soviet territory, dramatized the passage
from an offensive-defensive stage (on the part of Germany against the
Soviet Union) to one of stalemate; this was followed by an
offensive-defensive stage (on the part of the Soviet against the German
forces). As regards negation of the negation in the sphere of culture, a
writer in People\'s China likened the cultures of Asia and Africa, long
suppressed and despoiled by imperialism, to an ancient tree again
growing green to release its spring fragrance.

In sum, the idea of development, \"as formulated by Marx and Engels on
the basis of Hegel, . . . is far more comprehensive, far richer in
content than the current idea of evolution. A development that seemingly
repeats the stages already passed, but repeats them otherwise, on a
higher basis (\'negation of negation\'), a development, so to speak, in
spirals, not in a straight lint;---a development by leaps, catastrophes,
revolutions. . . .\"^34^ (Lenin)

*Antiscientific Views*

Opposed to the concept of negation, of development in a spiral, is the
tradi­tional mechanical concept of circular development---a
generalization to some extent derived from observation of natural
regularities (such as the cycles of the seasons, of tides, and of day
and night, and the birth, growth, and death of organisms), as well as
social regularities (repetitive phenomena of class society, particularly
in a caste-constituted structure, as in India).

Much like Aristotle, Nietzsche wrote: \"All things pass, all things
return; eternally turns the wheel of Being . . . eternally the house of
Being builds itself the same. All things part, all thing welcome each
other again; eternally the ring of Being abides by itself.\"\" In like
fashion, the historian Arnold Tovnbee affirmed a \"theory of cycles\"
that history is in essence circular. Understandably, bourgeois
ideologists who anchor the social psychology of humans to a biolog­ical,
animal-like base, rather than to their social existence, deem
Aristotle\'s wisdom on this subject still wise. What for Aristotle was a
prescientific intui­tion, at a time when scientific knowledge was
extremely limited, is for bourgeois ideologists mere apology, an
antiscience. They ignore or distort a mass of

*Appearance and Essence*

> Exposition of the dialectical categories be~t~zin\'s with
> appearance-essence as the threshold set of categories. This sequence
> is fundamental to exposition of the other dialectical (very general)
> categories inasmuch as they are aspects of a thing\'s essence. In this
> context, essence is the cornucopia from which other dialectical
> categories pour forth into understanding. Appearance-essence\'s
> pedagogic primacy coincides in the main with its historical
> relationship to other dialectical categories: appearance-essence is
> among the first dialectical categories comprehended lw humans.
>
> Appearance as the outer aspect of things (and essence as the inner
> aspect) is distinguished from appearance in the sense of coming into
> being or becoming known for the first time. To the appearance-essence,
> outer-inner levels of the object---of the external world---there
> corresponds the perceptual-conceptual levels of the subject, of the
> instrument of reflection: consciousness. These levels will be
> discussed in Chapter 20, on epistemology.
>
> **PRESCIENTIFIC VIEWS**
>
> Primitive man early became aware that nature hides many of its truths.
> From most ancient times, self-preservation depended on swift
> recognition of dangers lurking behind apparently harmless facades, on
> distinguishing real from seem­ing dangers. Forests, streams, and skies
> might seem placid and safe but could also harbor predators and other
> hazards. Sudden silence in a forest or brush­wood area when ordinarily
> there were sounds, or vice-versa, belied the visual absence of danger,
> alerting humans to its hidden presence. Animals and plants might
> resemble edible species but could actually be poisonous, or might
> appear inedible and actually be nutritious. The fact that objects fall
> to earth through no observable cause was construed as but one of many
> proofs that powerful beings lurked everywhere behind the scenes,
> ordaining the movement of things.
>
> This dichotomy in the nature of the real is reflected in the etymology
> of the term \"appearance.\" In its Greek origin the term has the same
> root-meaning of \"to shine, to be visible\" as the equivalent German
> *Schein.* Through struggle with nature, through advances in productive
> practice, humans repeatedly learned that to know the truth of things
> requires more than merely knowing their exterior, their superficial
> aspects, their appearance. Beneath the outer, readily perceptible
> vestments of a thing there is an inner, hidden, basic nature, its
> essence, less accessible to understanding. Profound truths elude
> superficial in­quiry.

> **An ancient proverb of an African tribal people reflects this
> duality: \"When an event occurs only a part of the truth is sent
> abroad, the rest is kept back.\"\' For a West African people, the
> Dogon of \\tali, levels of truth arc embodied in words: \"At first
> they received the \'word at face value\' (simple knowledge), then
> \'the word on the side,\' then the \'word from behind\' .. . \[and
> finally\] the \'clear word,\' the abstract and esoteric knowledge.\"\'
> A tribe has its professional diviners, and class society its clergy,

*Possibility and Actuality*

> **PRESCIENTIFIC VIEWS**
>
> The term \"possibility\" (potentiality) stems from the Latin for \"to
> be able\" and refers to the capacity of a thing-or a state of affairs
> to change---its \"iffyness.\" The term \"actuality,\" like
> \"activity,\" derives from \"act\" (something done) and refers to
> consummated possibility, a thing or state of affairs that has come
> into being. The processes of moving from possibility to actuality and
> from actuality to possibility arc transitions from \"can be\" to
> \"is,\" and the reverse.
>
> Primitive observation of a thing\'s properties (e.g., the flaking
> capability of certain kinds of stone) or of a thing\'s course of
> development (e.g., an acorn becoming a tree) provides data regarding a
> thing\'s capacity to change or to be changed from one state to
> another. By knowing certain conditions, humans can shape a certain
> kind of rock into an axe and can, by cultivation, develop wheat from a
> wild grass. In contriving the simplest tool or weapon, or in the
> domes­tication of plants and animals, primitive man utilized accurate
> data, developing and assembling the conditions requisite for the
> transformation of possibilities into actualities.
>
> From sensorimotor trial-and-error transfer to the most sophisticated
> experi­mental hypothesis, adaptation to present reality is complemented
> by a pro­gressive adaptation to future reality. Thus possibility enters
> the adaptation process, in the field of adaptations indispensable to
> action, in the form of the potential future . . . i.e., in every case
> in which the subject, after having imagined where each of two or
> several possible courses of action leads, must make a choice.\' (Maga)
>
> The mind constructs integral structures, organized to serve \"at a
> given moment as sources or reservoirs of possible operations. Only
> some of these come to be realized, but their realization is a function
> of the total system and consequently a function of the *potential* as
> much as the *actual.\'\"* (Piaget) For primitive man these objective
> possibilities were incorporated in magical explanatory systems used to
> explain any conceivable event.

>
> **SCIENTIFIC VIEWS**

> Possibility and actuality, the able-to-be and the has-become, the
> realizable and the realized---each is an inseparable aspect of a
> thing\'s nature. Development is the continuous conversion of
> possibility into actuality, and of actuality into possibility. A thing
> exists only by ceaselessly realizing a potential to become otherwise.
> Actuality is realized possibility, and possibility is not yet realized
> actuality. Reality, the objective, exists as much in its potentiality
> as in its actuality. Being is both an actualization of and a potential

CHAPTER 16.

*Contingency and Necessity*

> Two histories are involved in knowledge of necessity and contingency:
> a history of these overall concepts as such (an overview), and a
> history of their very general constituents: causality, law, and
> freedom. This overview is presented first. Similarly, in the
> prehistory sections of this chapter, the child\'s notions are
> presented first, inasmuch as their history converges with social
> history and significantly illuminates scientific and antiscientific
> conceptions of causality, law, and freedom.
>
> Causality is \"a special but very common form of necessity.\"\' (Bohm)
> Law here refers to the necessary, to scientific laws independent of
> human will, not those that are man-made, such as legislative laws.
> Scientific laws arc immanent, objective patterns in things---inherent
> uniformities---and not conformities im­posed by human will or any other
> external agency. Such laws do not rule over things; rather, they exist
> within things as aspects of their nature. Scientific laws describe;
> they do not command. The phrase \"necessity knows no law\" refers to
> human necessity disregarding *man-made* laws (e.g., a hungry,
> penniless person appropriating food). Persons acting under the spur of
> human (personal) neces­sity remain subject to objective, *scientific*
> laws.
>
> In this chapter, \"chance,\" \"accident,\" and \"contingency\" arc
> used inter­changeably, as roughly equivalent. The term \"contingency\"
> used in the title of this chapter is preferred because it is more
> accurate and more complete. Chance or accident connotes only an
> isolated event coming from nowhere, a bolt from the blue, while
> contingency\* contains also an element of conditionality, of the
> dependency, the interconnectedness of events. Chance is \"a certain
> very com­mon form of contingency. . . .\'\" (Bohm)
>
> **CONNECTIONS OF POSSIBILITY AND ACTUALITY\
> WITH CONTINGENCY AND NECESSITY**
>
> Contingency and necessity are linked with actuality and possibility.
> The overall continuity between them is, in brief, as follows.
> Actuality and possibil­ity are opposite aspects of a thing\'s
> essence---its existent aspects (what \"is\") and its realizable
> aspects (what \"can be\"). A thing is a composite of closed and
> closable links, some of which become actualized in the course of its
> development while others become precluded. Contingency and necessity
> are like artificers

> \*Other terms substantially related to contingency, as describing the
> non-necessary, are fortui­tous, casual, irregular, arbitrary, random,

*Scientific Views*

> Freedom has a very general, philosophic context, as well as a
> particular, social frame of reference. In its human connotation,
> freedom commences with the first form of human society, no matter how
> tenuous and limited but yet nevertheless a collective approach to
> nature that initiates the process of the self-creation of human beings
> through their own labor. Inherent in this approach, and based on
> advances in productive labor and mutual exchange, new qualitative
> possibilities arise of knowing the necessities of nature and of human
> nature, and thus of achieving ever greater human control over both.
>
> In its philosophic context, to be free does not mean to be free of
> *all* restraint. On the contrary, freedom requires the presence of
> natural and social constraints independent of human will. Necessity
> with its laws is the material basis for freedom.
>
> Knowledge of the necessary is the first prerequisite of freedom.
> Freedom apart from knowledge of necessity lacks content and is a mere
> abstract \"identity of the will with itself. . . .\"\'°\' (Hegel)
> Freedom, a \"free necessity\" (Spinoza), can begin only where
> ignorance of necessity ends.
>
> Freedom \"is not a violation of lawlike behavior but a type of it,
> namely, self-determination,\"\'\" (Bunge) human actions knowingly
> based on the law-gov­erned. To insist on freedom via independence of
> laws is to perpetuate error and defeat. Walt Whitman---who wrote

*The Social Context of Freedom*

> Freedom\'s philosophic meaning is inseparable from its less general,
> social context. In the immediate, literal sense, freedom means having
> a range of choices among available and avoidable positives and
> negatives, a freedom \"to\" and a freedom \"from.\" Knowledge of
> necessity and rational control of feeling (\"will\") are instruments
> that further the realization of freedom\'s \"to\'s\" and \"from\'s.\"
> What is crucial is the quality of choices, for good or ill, rather
> than their number.
>
> The fundamental basis of these choices is societal, the relations of
> socially organized humans to nature and to each other. Apart from
> society, freedom is a void. The individual isolated since infancy from
> contact with others cannot rise above animal consciousness to a human
> level: \"only in the community, there­fore, is personal freedom
> possible.\"\"° (Marx and Engels) Historically, freedom is a variable,
> a measure of the attainment of constructive human powers in the
> difficult ascent of humans toward increasing control over nature and
> them­selves.
>
> Freedom spans the gamut from a primitive level to a universality of
> needs, capacities (especially productive powers), and
> enjoyments---from primitive communism to class society and then to
> modern communal society, three over­all modes of production that
> decisively affect freedom\'s nature and scope. Free­dom attains this
> universality in modern communal society---the elimination of classes
> and of the division between town and countryside, between industry and
> agriculture and between manual and mental labor, as well as the
> shortening of the work day and the achieving of payment to each
> according to need. The

*Laws of Epistemology*

> **PRESCIENTIFIC TO SCIENTIFIC**
>
> This chapter\'s mode of exposition differs in three main respects from
> the tripar­tite division (prescientific, scientific, antiscientific) in
> most chapters:

1.  The first section---Child Mental Development---is an admixture
    > of (a) as­pects of child mental development which continue, albeit
    > modified, in adult rational functioning (for example, certain laws
    > relating to scnsorimotor and intuitive thought) and (b) aspects of
    > child mental development which do not continue at the adult level.

2.  Similarly, the second section---Aspects of the History of
    > Cognition---is an admixture, the first part focusing on the
    > prescientific kind of development and the second part on aspects
    > of scientific cognition.

3.  Epistemology concerns itself with the theory of scientific
    > knowledge. Ac­cordingly, the laws and categories of dialectics of
    > the object---which are con­stituents of scientific comprehension of
    > the object, and arc the subject matter of the prior exposition in
    > this book---being ^-^components also of epistemology, arc used in
    > this chapter. For instance, form and content as well as the
    > particular and the general are aspects of both the external world
    > and of human thought. To deepen and consistently maintain
    > dialectical materialist comprehension and ac­tion, it is essential
    > to know very general aspects of the universe (present in nature,
    > society, and thought) and very general, ever-present aspects of
    > rational thought (not present in nature) used in comprehending the
    > universe. For exam­ple theory and practice are aspects (mental
    > processes) ever-present in rational thought but not in nature.

> The portion of this chapter on child mental development is very
> largely based on the encyclopedic psychological research and seminal
> insights of Jean Piaget and his colleagues.\* Piaget emphasized that
> these insights are not sacrosanct and require confirmation by
> historical, sociological, and other methods before his findings could
> scientifically qualify as laws of epistemology. Further data,
> con­tinually being accumulated through refining and modifying certain
> aspects of Piaget\'s work, including the timing and rigidity of stages
> (e.g., making earlier the possible age at which a child begins a step
> in its development or manifests aspects of a more advanced stage),
> tend to confirm Piaget\'s basic concepts,
>
> \*Piaget and his colleagues at the Institut de Jean Jacques Rousseau
> in Switzerland also used and fully acknowledged the contributions of

1.  Piaget\'s theory is integral, a totality whose parts are
    > indispensable for retention of the theory\'s quality, but the
    > theory does cover a very considerable body of knowledge, much of
    > it unfamiliar to many readers.

2.  Elaboration of the general features of child thought development
    > necessar­ily involves abstractions and assigns scientific meanings
    > to terms which to many readers initially seem imprecise and
    > elusive, all the more because these terms usually have a variety
    > of meanings in everyday usage. Although at the outset his
    > terminology may seem vague, through rereading and practical
    > application one comes to see that his concepts are actually quite
    > precise.

> Trying to case this situation for the reader by excising integral

> detract from scientific comprehen­sion of this theory. However, a

> In correlating and compressing highlights of over twenty-five books by

*Introduction*

> In the exposition so far of dialectics, including that of
> epistemology, certain very general cognitive instrumentalities, sets
> of categories, were used but not elaborated: the abstract-the
> concrete, analysis-synthesis, and theory-practice. These elusive
> mental \"tools\" helped in comprehending both the very general laws
> and categories of dialectics of the object (aspects present in all
> spheres, including thought), as well as the very general
> epistemological laws. Now, in turn, these laws and categories can be
> employed to illuminate these \"tools\" and thereby elucidate the as

> (aspects limited to rational consciousness and always present in
> rational consciousness), the dialectical categories.
> Induction-deduction, an overall cogni­tive framework within which these
> three sets of categories function, is used as an introduction, a
> foundation for their exposition.

is mainly the fault of inexperienced or inept travelers and not of
abstraction as such. \"Thought proceeding from the concrete to the
abstract---provided it is *correct . . .* does not get *away from* the
truth but comes closer to it. The abstraction of *matter,* of a *law* of
nature, the abstraction of *value, etc.,* in short *all* scientific
(correct, serious, not absurd) abstractions reflect nature more deeply,
truly and *completely.\"* (Lenin)

The abstract is not an end point of cognition, but an intermediate
stage, a momentary resting place between the superficial concrete and
the profound concrete. \"The concrete concept is concrete because it is
a synthesis of many definitions, thus representing the unity of diverse
aspects\" (Nlarx)\--the dis­covery of the same (general, as well as very
general), as well as the different (particular, as well as unique)
aspects conjoined in things.

The generalities discerned in the process of abstraction arc real parts
of the object, but they arc not real apart from it. Abstraction is
properly a phase in a transition, in a continuum, and not a terminus of
inquiry. Permanent severance of aspects turns dissection into
dcssication. \"Healthy human reason goes out towards what is concrete .
. .\" (legcl)\--the abstractions discerned by thought concretely
integrated in the object. \"The fundamental thesis of dialectics is:
there is no such thing as abstract truth, truth is always
concrete.\"\'\' (Lenin) The vitality of generalities depends on their
unity with particulars in constituting the object, the concrete
profoundly comprehended, the object as a whole, both its inner and outer
aspects.

The abstract and the concrete arc inseparable opposites. The abstract,
severed from the concrete, is immobile, a lifeless fragment. Equally,
the con­crete cannot be profoundly concrete apart from the abstract. \"It
is necessary to advance unceasingly toward greater generality without,
however, wanting to cut the bonds which unite abstraction to concrete
reality.\" (Le Lionnais)

The abstract and the concrete interpenetrate each other, ceaselessly
changing place, each transforming itself into the other. Abstractness
becomes con­creteness; concreteness becomes abstractness. What is
concrete in one context can become abstract in another context, and
vice-versa. Similarly, progress in knowledge continually discloses
errors and the incompleteness in what previ­ously was believed to be
fully concrete. Thus the concrete can be concrete only by leaving open
the door to---and by never being walled off from---further abstraction.
\"The words \'abstraction\' and \'generalization\' describe not static
stituations or end results but dynamic processes directed from some
concrete stratum to some \'higher\' one.\"\" (Courant) The absoluteness
of each never ceases to be also relative, an absolute only within a
relative context.

The concrete is inexhaustible. The universal is not a finale---as such,
\"it is dead, impure, incomplete, etc.\"---\"but it alone is a *stage*
towards knowledge of the *concrete,* for we can never know the concrete
completely. The *infinite* sum of general conceptions, laws, etc., gives
the *concrete in* its completeness.\'^24^ (Lenin) The movement of the
mind toward comprehension of \"the concrete in its com­pleteness\" arises
in a ceaseless interchange between knowing and doing. \"The process of
(transitory, finite, limited) cognition and *action* converts abstract
concepts into *perfected objectivity.\"\"* (Lenin)

> they have no objective validity whatsoever.\'\" Aver contends that
> \"ethical concepts are pseudo-concepts and consequently

*Analysis and Synthesis*

> Analysis and synthesis, in the sense of a breaking down and a building
> up, is an objective, very general process, ceaselessly occurring in
> all things, at every level of being, inanimate and animate, including
> the human body. Thus \"living cells continually synthesize proteins
> from amino acids and continually take proteins apart. In healthy
> tissues the mass of protein inside the cells is kept in equilib­rium by
> a balance between synthesis on the one hand and degradation \[on the
> other\] . . . the degradation process is as important as
> synthesis.\"\' (Thomsen) Resembling this bifurcation in the objective
> process arc two streams of thinking in the sciences, one centering on
> the analytic aspect and the other on the synthetic.
>
> Analysis and synthesis arc also a mode of cognition, an instrument
> that mentally breaks down an object into components and then
> integrates or builds up these components into objects, the better to
> comprehend their nature. This chapter will focus on features of
> analysis and synthesis as a very general mode of cognition.
>
> The term \"analysis\" and \"synthesis\" also have specialized
> meanings. For instance, in logical semantics: in a formalized
> language, propositions whose truth is ascertainable by the rules
> governing the system arc termed analytic; propositions requiring
> recourse to facts arc termed synthetic. Thus, logicians distinguish
> between (1) logical (analytic) truths that arc the necessarily valid
> deductions from certain assumptions or premises which arc not
> established as true (including a *priori* truths), such as the
> \"truths\" of religion; and (2) factual (synthetic) truths that arc
> directly, physically verifiable. *\"Synthetic sentences are the
> genuine statements about reality.\'\"* (Carnap)

> **PRESCIENTIFIC VIEWS**
>
> The possession of hands uniquely endows humans with a precise
> instrument to pull things apart and then put them together, thereby
> exposing their nature to scrutiny. But hands do not function by
> themselves. Their movement and dexterity develop in coordination with
> sensory organs. Sensory organs have analyzers, an apparatus that
> breaks down data received from the external world into constituents
> and transmits them to the brain. \"Consider the retina, **it**

> Though analysis and synthesis arc both omnipresent in cognition of a

**CHAPTER** 26.

*Dialectics of the Object and of the Subject as a Whole*

> Dialectics as a whole, its totality, comprises two overall parts: the
> *dialectics of the object* (the very general aspects of the
> universe---aspects present in nature, soci­ety, and thought) and the
> *dialectics of the subject* (the very general aspects of rational
> cognition, of epistemology, including genetic epistemology, i.e., the
> very general aspects of the processes involved in attaining the
> rational, the scientific level of cognition).
>
> The *dialectics of the object* includes laws and categories present in
> all processes, in all things---nature, society, and thought. As
> regards the presence of these laws and categories, humans are like the
> rest of the cosmos.
>
> The *dialectics of the subject* refers to aspects in which humans
> differ from the rest of the cosmos. At a rational level, human
> cognition possesses aspects that are not found in other things, except
> in more or less rudimentary modes in certain other forms of life.
> Consciousness serves as the instrument that, in a ceaseless
> interchange, through actions reflects the nature of the object and of
> itself, of its own mode of functioning. In the development of children
> to adulthood, and of society from a primitive to a relatively advanced
> level, con­sciousness ascends (1) to knowledge of the very general laws
> and categories present, so far as known, in all things throughout the
> universe, and (2) to a high level of self-awareness---to knowledge of
> the additional laws and categories present in attaining, and in the
> functioning of, rational cognition---scientific epistemology.
>
> Knowledge of the dialectics of the object and of the dialectics of the
> subject developed somewhat separately. Dialectical knowledge of
> cognition, i.e., of the subject, is more elusive and harder to
> achieve, and its scientific investigation is severely hindered by
> capitalists, so that much of this self-knowledge is learned later than
> knowledge of the dialectics of the object. Yet, without the use by
> consciousness, albeit not fully consciously, of the very general
> epistemological laws and categories, cognition of the dialectics of
> the object---of the very general aspects of all things---would be
> impossible.
>
> The term \"dialectics\" is frequently equated with dialectics of the
> object. This limitation creates confusion and a distortion separating
> the dialectics of the object from that of consciousness---the very
> general source and aspects of knowledge from its instrumentality, the
> known from the knower, dialectics from epistemology, a whole from one
> of its parts.

> As for epistemology or the theory of scientific knowledge. . . .Thc
> symp­toms of this dissociation \[in relation to metaphysics\] are
> numerous and they all indicate more or less clearly the desire felt by

>
> Piaget also stresses the interconnections of scientific research in
> epistemology with research in other special sciences:
>
> scientific psychology would not be able to work without a

> As regards dialectics of the object and dialectics of the subject

> is presented first. Dialectics of the object is more readily
> apprehensible, and is accordingly used to facilitate the grasping of
> the dialectics of the subject---the more difficult task of
> consciousness, the self, profoundly comprehending itself.
>
> Pedagogic considerations are also involved in the tripartite division
> made in the exposition of dialectics of the object: the transition of
> cognition from the outer nature of things (appearance) to the first
> law of dialectics (Chapter 5), then the three laws of dialectics, and
> lastly the section on dialectical categories. To have confronted the
> reader at the outset with the first law of dialectics---the most
> general law of motion of the universe (as presently known)---would
> pre­sent special obstacles to comprehension; these obstacles have been

> important aspects of dialectics.

> This prefatory chapter was designed to provide a series of logical
> steps so as to make the passage from everyday understanding to the
> first law easier and more manageable. A commonly used transition was
> rejected, the one that pre­sents the second law as an introduction to

>
> **In *Philosophical Notebooks---source* material for an intended
> treatise on dialecti­cal materialism---Lenin listed as elements of
> dialectics:**

1.  **The *objectivity* of consideration (not examples, not divergences,
    > but the Thing-in-itself).**

2.  **The entire totality of the manifold *relations* of this thing to
    > others.**

3.  **The *development* of this thing (phenomenon, respectively), its
    > own movement, its own life.**

4.  **The internally contradictory *tendencies (and* sides) in this
    > thing.**

5.  **The thing (phenomenon, etc.) as the sum *and unity of
    > opposites.***

6.  **The *struggle,* respectively unfolding, of these opposites,
    > contradictory strivings, etc.**

7.  **The union of analysis and synthesis---the breakdown of the
    > separate parts and the totality, the summation of these parts.**

8.  **The relations of each thing (phenomenon, etc.) arc not only
    > manifold, but general, universal. Each thing (phenomenon, process,
    > etc.) is con­nected with *every other.***

9.  **Not only the unity of opposites, but the *transitions of ever)^,^*
    > determina­tion, quality, feature, side, property into *every* other
    > (into its opposite?).**

10. **The endless process of the discovery of *new* sides, relations,
    > etc.**

11. **The endless process of the deepening of man\'s knowledge of the
    > thing,**

12. From coexistence to causality and from one form of connection and
    > reciprocal dependence to another, deeper, more general form.

13. The repetition at a higher stage of certain features, properties,
    > etc., of the lower and

14. The apparent return to the old (negation of the negation).

15. The struggle of content with form and conversely. The throwing off
    > of the form, the transformation of the content.

16. The transition of quantity into quality and *vice versa* (15 and 16
    > arc *examples* of 9).^11^

> Lenin characterized the unity and conflict of opposites as central to
> dialectics: \"In brief, dialectics can be defined as the doctrine of

>
> In his *Capita/,* Marx first analyzes the simplest, most ordinary,
> fundamental, most common and everyday *relation* of bourgeois
> (commodity) society, a relation that is encountered billions of times,

> Consequently, opposites (the singular as opposed to the general) are

> the general. The general exists only in the singular and through the

> Every general only approximately comprises all the singular objects.
> Every singular enters incompletely into the general, etc., etc. Every

DIALECTICS OF THE OBJECT AND THE SUBJECT 4 1 1

**In this section we have distinguished in the major works of Engels
seven**

**distinct meanings of the term dialectic insofar as it bears upon
natural**

> **phenomena. They arc:**

(1) **dialectic as a constitutive principle of all things---a universal
    > form of behavior to which there arc no actual or conceivable
    > exceptions . . .**

> (Dialectics comprises universal constituents, and is not \"a
> constitutive princi­ple,\" \"a universal form of behavior.\" Dialectics
> connotes a sum of very general aspects present in things/processes, as
> contrasted with the mystifying, idealist use of the term \"the
> dialectic,\" which ascribes to dialectics a single, directing
> \"constitutive principle.\")

(2) **dialectic as the logical pattern of transition and continuity . .
    > .**

> (\"Pattern\" is vague, giving no inkling of the three laws of
> dialectics \[very general laws of motion\] and the dialectical
> categories. Similarly, \"logical\" is here not clearly used as meaning
> the objectively universal.)

(1) dialectic as **the logic of disjunction in situations where two
    > alternatives arc exclusive and exhaustive . . .**

> (This describes formal logic with its either-or, and not dialectics
> with its first law---the inseparable unity and conflict of polar
> opposites, their interpenetra­tion, etc.)

(3) **dialectic as the principle of polar opposition . . .**

> **(This omits mention** of the *unity* of polar opposites and is a
> reworded formula­tion of \[3\], \"polar opposition,\" in place of
> \"exclusive and exhaustive\" alterna­tives. Here again a fragment of
> dialectics---and that distorted---is equated to the whole.)

(4) **dialectic as a special constitutive principle whose existential
    > locus is the development of** *concepts . .*

> (Dialectics as scientific epistemology, as what Piagct calls \"a norm
> toward which reason tends as it is gradually refined and purified,\"
> has a source in child cognitive development---genetic epistemology,
> the processes in which reason and logic arc constructed and formed.
> Dialectics comprises very general aspects of the objective and is not
> a \"constitutive principle\"---\"special\" or otherwise. The
> characterization \"existential locus in the development of
> *concepts\"* is a mere hocus-pocus.)
>
> \*Anthony Nlanser illuminates some of the social implications of
> \"constitutive\": \"Sartre distin­guishes between **a
> \'constitutive\'** and a \'constituted\' dialectic \[i.e., one derived
> from the objec­tive). . . . Only the former !according to Sartre\' is
> really \'dialectic.\' Part of what Sartre wants to claim is that men
> make their own chains, rather than being chained by an existing
> society\" (\"Practice and Dialectic in Sartre\'s *Critique,\"* in
> Warnock. *Sartre,* p. 344). Contrary to this either---or version,
> actually constituent and constitutive are conjoined. By understanding
> dialectics as disclosing very general constituents of the world (and
> this as primary), the mind has **a** guide to organizing the world to
> one\'s purposes, for the mind to be constitutive of things on an
> objective basis. In this process the constitutive discloses new
> constituents.
>
> 412 DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM

(6) dialectic as the constitutive and heuristic principle that all
    > things are systematically interrelated . . .

> (As regards dialectics, all things are interrelated, not
> \"systematically inter­related,\" whatever that may be. Universal
> interrelatedness is *an* aspect of dialectics---of the nature of all
> things---but is not \"the constitutive principle\" and not even a
> constitutive *principle.* Universal interrelatedness does provide a
> \[not \"the\"\] very general facet in a scientific mode of inquiry. As
> such, it is useful \[among many ways\] as a \"heuristic principle,\"
> i.e., serving to discover or reveal the truth and expose fallacies and
> rhetoric as regards arguments and methods of demonstration which may
> be psychologically persuasive rather than are logi­cally compelling.)

(7) dialectic as a groping, first approximation to the logic of
    > scientific method.\"

> (Dialectics comprises very general objective aspects \[involving a
> level of cogni­tion derived from the whole of knowledge---the special
> sciences, technology, the arts, etc.\] and, as such, together with
> materialism, a science. As universally present, these aspects are
> equally universally applicable, and constitute a very general,
> indispensable part of scientific method, basically distinct from \"a
> grop­ing, first approximation to the logic of scientific method,\" such
> as that described in genetic epistemology.)
>
> With this enumeration as his foundation, Hook learnedly proceeds, with
> permutations and combinations of the \"seven distinct meanings of the
> term dialectic,\" to show that they are incompatible with one another.
> Presumably, after the buffeting I-look gives his imaginary versions of
> dialectics, a reader\'s initial interest in dialectics is turned into

> infected with ambiguity, that it is not likely to function as a
> serviceable designation for any concept or intellectual procedure in
> any in­quiry which aims at the achievement of reliable knowledge about
> ourselves and the world we live in.\"\"
>
> Hook\'s supercilious sophistries---a hodge-podge of distortions,

>
> If the dialectic is a description of the ways in which human beings

**CONCLUSION**

> **SCIENTIFIC** VIEws
>
> Dialectical materialism as a whole is a synthesis of syntheses, a peak
> from which to take an overview of the historic ascent of consciousness
> to knowledge of very general aspects of the cosmos, including
> consciousness itself. The unity of the world is absolute in that all
> things objectively exist; and it is relative in that the existence of
> each at a particular level of development, including human­ity, is
> temporary.
>
> In materialism, consciousness bifurcates reality into the external
> world (the object) and consciousness of the external world (the
> subject), Truth involves the cardinal overall relationship between the
> object and the subject, and mate­rialism affirms the primacy of the
> object and that practice is the test of truth. This \"bifurcation\"
> (with its categories of object and subject) and this \"overall
> relationship\" (with its categories of truth and of the test of truth)
> arc law-governed.
>
> **In** dialectics, consciousness proceeds, using this materialist
> foundation, to disclose the inner nature of the object and the subject
> and makes further bifurca­tions, splitting each into two parts. In
> dialectics of the object, the object is at the outset divided by
> consciousness, disclosing two levels of truth about the ob­ject---an
> outer, relatively superficial truth (appearance) and an inner,
> relatively profound truth (essence). Inner truth, very general
> aspects, comprises a duality of very general categories and laws. In
> dialectics of the subject, the subject (consciousness) is at the
> outset divided, disclosing two levels of truth in the subject\'s mode
> of cognizing the object: an outer, relatively superficial mode
> (perception) and an inner, relatively profound mode (conception).\*
> These bifur­cations of the object and the subject arc correlated: the
> outer aspects of the object with perceptual reflection and the inner
> aspects with conceptual reflec­tion. The dialectics of the object and
> the subject, of the thing known and the instrument of knowing, are
> inseparable. Truth is integral.

Attainment of a high level of wisdom entitled its possessor to an
influential status. Thus, \"There were among the Iroquois Indians . . .
a body of the Keepers of the Faith \'selected by the wise men and
matrons of each gens (clan). \' \"\' (Chattopadhyaya)

**436 DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM**

**mores. For them \"the distinction between science and philosophy did
not exist.\"\" (Piaget) Identifying wisdom with objective fundamental
truth, Herac-litus wrote that wisdom is \"to understand the purpose
which steers all things through all things\" and \"to speak the truth
and to act according to nature, paying heed thereto\"; those \"who love
wisdom must be inquirers into very many things indeed.\" Aristotle
maintained \"that wisdom is a science dealing with first principles\"
and that \"sophistry,\" the partly true and partly specious learning
dispensed by some itinerant teachers, \"is but apparent wisdom. . •
.\"\" I le affirmed that \"physics too is a kind of wisdom. . . .\"\"**

**In a kind of people\'s mythology, as in the legends of Prometheus and
Her­cules, and in proverbs, the exploited evidenced an unshaken belief in
their own version of wise ends (values) and wise means to attain these
ends. Confronted by a world infested by monsters, both human and
supernatural, that served their oppressors, the people in their wisdom
created a hero to symbolize their defiance of material and spiritual
bonds. The Titan Prometheus was chained to a rock by Zeus for having
brought fire to mankind and instruction in the crafts. To Hermes, the
messenger of the gods, who brought Zeus\'s offer of release in return
for submission, Prometheus responded:**

> **In simple words,**
>
> **I hate the pack of gods.**
>
> **Be sure of this, I would not change my state**

**Of evil fortune for your servitude.**

**Better to be the servant of this rock**

**Than to be faithful bov to Father Zeus.**

> **(Aeschylus, *Prometheus Bound)***

**Marx concluded the foreword to his doctoral dissertation on Greek
philoso­phy: \"Prometheus is the most eminent saint and martyr in the
philosophical calendar.\"**

**Folklore constitutes a treasury of the people\'s deep inner life,
their wisdom---the basic, durable residue of age-old collective
experience and insight. Much of folklore expresses the masses\'
invincible aspirations for a better life---the values conducive to their
welfare, and the interim principles for survival and eventual success.

Wisdom is not the exclusive prerogative of the longer living. Contrary
to Hegel, who declared that \"the owl of Minerva begins its flight only
at dusk,\"\" history continually evidences the talents and profound
insights of the young in the sciences, in the arts, and in technology,
as well as in philosophy. In its full potential wisdom is truly a
collective, ceaseless intermingling of new infusions from the three
generations (young, middle-aged, and longer-living), an inter­mingling
which in communist society will be pervasive and without systemic social
barriers, whether of class, nationality, age or gender.

Such a collectivity of expertise in dialectical and historical
materialism is essential for profound, wise foresight and provides the
basis of scientific investi­gation and theory: \"the Marxist is *the
first* to foresee the onset of a revolutionary epoch and to begin to
arouse the people and ring the alarm bell, while the philistines sleep
the slavish sleep of the loyal subject.\" (Lenin)

This foresight has limits. Marx rejected a dogmatic anticipation of the
future and the elaboration of ready-made solutions for all future times.
Similarly, Lenin disclaimed such superhuman wisdom: \"We do not claim
that Marx or the Marxists know the road to socialism in every concrete
detail. That would be nonsense. We know the direction of the road, we
know what class forces arc following the road; but the concrete and
practical details will be learned only from the experience of the
millions, when they begin to take action.\"

The most profound, the most complete, the wisest anticipation
necessarily falls short of the actual dimensions of an historical event,
especially as regards social revolutions. A flexibility comporting with
history\'s partial predictability is requisite, a wise anticipation
coupled with an adequate receptivity to the totality of events:

Such passion is not incompatible with logic. In fact, \"Nothing great in
the world has been accomplished without passion. . . .\"\" (Lenin) For
full rational­ity, passion must be combined with logic, with logic in
command, especially in the struggle against bourgeois power: \"criticism
is no passion of the head, it is the head of passion.\"\" (Marx)\*
Marxists \"can, and must, combine the most intense passion in the great
revolutionary struggle with the coolest and most sober estimation of the
mad ravings of the bourgeoisie.\" (Lenin) In such a struggle, the
integration of these levels of feeling (expressed in values) and

essential truth belicing. The wisdom of the working class integrates all
that is forward-moving---the scientific and the revolutionary---and
discards all that is decayed and false. Increasingly, the wisdom of the
imperialists is their cunning, encompassing all that is regressive and
enslaving---the unscientific and the coun­terrevolutionary. The epoch of
the class-society sage---such as Confucius, the Buddha, and Moses---is
nearing its close. Coming into being on a world scale is the epoch of
the long-repressed masses, able to contribute more wisely and
significantly than ever before to the shaping of their own and
society\'s future, finally ending the antagonistic dichotomy in wisdom,
\"the rift between clever hands and the clever mind\"\' (Gorky), between
culture and labor, and between social science-scientific philosophy and
the rest of the sciences.

Whole humans joined together can attain ever higher levels of scientific
wis­dom. A new and typical human, wielding the working class\' \"best
weapon, its sharpest tool\" (Engels)---dialectical and historical
materialism---makes a giant advance toward the profoundly rational, the
truly wise, in intelligence and feeling, casting aside the outworn and
constrictive, and launching society on a course much more conducive to
humanity\'s well-being: \"when the narrow bourgeois form has been peeled
away, what is wealth, if not the universality of needs, capacities,
enjoyments, productive powers, etc., of individuals, pro­duced in
universal exchange? What, if not the full development of human control
over the forces of nature---those of his own nature, as well as those of
so-called \`nature\'?\"\'s (Marx) In this epoch, for the people, the
acme of wisdom in setting social goals, on which all other wisdoms
ultimately depend, is with the least cost and in the shortest time to
achieve socialism and the transition to a fully communist society.

The wisdom of class society\'s rulers is waning; the wisdom of the
oppressed, incomparably higher, is becoming ascendant. The 1842
prediction of Marx will be fulfilled: \"Our philosophy will become a
world philosophy, the world will become a philosophical world.\" The
comparatively short period of transition from ancient to modern
communism---the epoch of class society---is coming to a close. The much
longer age of modern classless society is approaching. Hasten the time,
and, as Mao adjured, \"Be resolute, fear no sacrifice and surmount every
difficulty to win victory!\"

*On Historical Experience with Socialist Revolution\
and Its Consolidation: A Query and a Hypothesis*

**A QUERY**

**The data in this essay are presented solely (1) to validate the query
whether, in this historical period, there exists a law affecting
socialist transition, and (2), correlatively, to sufficiently establish
as deserving further inquiry the hy­pothesis made here regarding such a
law. The intention of this exposition is to stimulate such an inquiry
and to help orient and implement the search for a scientific answer.
Clearly, validating the hypothesis requires the use of a much broader
range of data and analysis than here presented. The data adduced arc
relevant to the formulation and substantiation of the hypothesis that
the overall course of development of the USSR since 1917 and of the
People\'s Republic of China since 1949 have a common law-governed
nature.**

**Though at times in this analysis the hypothesis regarding the
existence of such a law is expressed in categoric form (as if it was a
proven law), this is done simply as a matter of convenience, to avoid
burdensome repetition that only a hypothesis about a law (and not a law)
is being posited.**

**Why is this essay included in a book on dialectical materialism, and
yet, at least in form, not included but presented as an addendum?
Because, while not a formal part of dialectical materialism, the
essay\'s subject matter is intimately connected with the vitality of
dialectical materialism\'s use. Just as in the classic tradition,
physicians were admonished to heal themselves, so also an exposition of
dialectical materialism, if it is to be centrally concerned with
changing the world and not only or primarily with interpreting it,
should appropriately conclude by utilizing this philosophy\'s concepts
in making a scientific analysis of socialism\'s basic course in this
epoch.**

**Any such scientific inquiry vitally depends on an unswerving
materialist outlook (on firm adherence to the primacy of the objective,
without reserva­tions) and on a dialectical approach, a vigorous probing
toward totality in its many-sidedness and profundity (on fully using the
laws and categories of dialectics). All the laws and categories are
importantly involved in this inquiry but especially in the forefront as
a guide are: (1) the first law of dialectics, the unity and conflict of
opposites (in this instance, centrally, antagonistic oppo­sites),
including their interpenetration, their shift in preeminence; and (2)
the dialectical categories---principally appearance-essence,
contingency-necessity, and particular-general---so as to be basically
oriented toward ascertaining the**

inner nature of things, of events (and not being confined to and
confused by the superficial), above all in disclosing the law-governed
in what is seemingly only accidental, and the general in what is
seemingly only particular. The utilization of dialectical materialism in
making an assessment of society\'s fateful direction at this turning
point is, at bottom, a concrete mode of uniting dialectical mate­rialism
and historical materialism, a scientific way of delineating and fleshing
out a crucial phase in their ceaselessly evolving and integral
relationship.

As class society\'s convulsions intensify, what is wise tends to be
narrowed to a question of the sheer survival of humanity itself. For
some this is a question without an affirmative answer. Of those who
believe humanity will survive, a considerable number look to the future
with little hope. For them, only social darkness lies ahead, offering a
choice of dead ends, a choice between continuing a decayed capitalism or
supplanting it with a discredited socialism.

Plainly, the deepening and accelerating crises endemic to the capitalist
system arc paralleled by serious questions regarding a basic change in
direction of communist parties and socialist governments, once clearly
revolutionary. While some people still deem these parties and
governments to be completely faithful to their socialist mandate, others
view them as having abandoned it, thus tar­nishing the very name of
socialism and rendering suspect the Marxist-Leninist doctrines and
values these parties and governments professedly embody. To these
skeptical or cynical millions, increasingly impelled into the arena of
class struggle, the way to the social exit from capitalism and the road
to a higher society may seem either nonexistent or at best obscure, if
not a mirage. Yet somewhat as in other periods of basic social change,
lurking deep down in much of this skepticism and cynicism, there is a
duality. There is not only a closure, a rejection of the world \"as
is,\" but also a connection to a new beginning, a reaching out, as yet
inchoate and amorphous, toward a finer society.

For many of those searching for a scientific road, the present crisis in
Marx­ism-Leninism is totally unsettling, much as was the reaction in
regard to as­tronomy in Copernicus\' day. He complained that astronomers
were so

Einstein wrote of a similar period of perplexity and instability in the
sphere of physics (circa 1910), arising from the growing inadequacy of
accepted theory to cope with somewhat discordant, accumulating data:
\"It was as if the ground had been pulled out from under one\'s feet,
with no firm foundation on which to build to be seen anywhere.\"\'

was puny.\* Conversely, the adverse outcome of the struggle to
consolidate these breakthroughs has to that extent validated his theory.
Is there a law involved, and, if so, how is it to be formulated?

The 1917 and 1949 socialist breakthroughs occurred in largely, if not
pre­dominantly, semifeudal-scmicolonial countries with a relatively very
small working class, where capitalist development was limited and
imperialism was weak, and, as regards 1917, at a time when imperialist
countries were locked in sanguinary struggle, and, with respect to 1949,
this was the climactic outcome of a process well underway before the war
began. Difficult as these socialist revolutions were to achieve, they
were only the prelude to, and simply set the stage for, the much more
intricate, arduous, and prolonged struggle for their consolidation.

From their inception, and in their ensuing course of development, the
USSR and the PRC had innumerable accidental aspects, unique to each,
including some of considerable importance, such as Lenin\'s five short
years of effective life after 1917 and Mao\'s long life after 1949.

These accidental individual aspects were conjoined with a composite of
nec­essary general features. At their birth both the USSR and the PRC
were confronted with imperialist military attacks and with internal
chaos, including runaway inflation and collapsed production. Each
started with the world of commodity economy and of bourgeois values in
operation, such as the inequal­ity inherent in equal pay for equal
work.\*\* Each started with the three major differences inherited from
class society: between mental and manual labor, between industry and
agriculture, and between town and countryside. Each started with an
economy heavily weighted on the side of small-scale production, an
economy that ceaselessly engendered capitalism. Each started with an
intel­ligentsia and technically trained cadres almost exclusively rooted
in an idealist or metaphysical world outlook and in bourgeois values.
All these conditions were inevitable legacies of countries largely or
mainly semifeudal-semicolonial, embarking on socialist transition in the
epoch of imperialism; none of these conditions were purely happenstance
and individual, though each had such aspects.

Equally, from inception to completion (the full establishment of modern
communal society---economically, politically, psychologically, and
ideologi-

\*ln their later years, both %larx and Engels envisaged the possibility
that czarist Russia might be among the first to have a socialist
revolution.

\*\*Formal equality---for instance, paying a person who supports a
family the same wage as a single person---results in essential
inequality. For equality to be basically consistent, remuneration must
conform to need.

462 DIALECTICAL MATERIALISM

what is socialism? and what is capitalism? The ensuing exposition
attempts to shed some light on these questions. In essence they involve
the basic course of action of the class in power, bourgeoisie or working
class, i.e., the composite of relations that gets stronger and the
composite of relations that gets weaker. However compromised and
marginal, socialism remains qualitatively distinct from capitalism in
its world outlook, the philosophy it inculcates, the social values it
espouses, and the fundamental economic and political course it follows.

What is clear and definite at the outset is that these distinctions
raise mainly questions of essence, of the quality of the process, and
not merely or primarily ones of appearance. For example, is adherence to
the views of Marx, Engels, Lenin and Mao as foundational, actual or
merely professed, and is collective ownership of certain resources
substantive or only formal? That in the USSR and the 1^3^11C many social
welfare benefits arc conferred is not by itself decisive.

A socialist course necessarily entails complex, arduous, and protracted
strug­gles in which backward social relations (and the technology with
which they are correlated), psychology, and ideology become increasingly
socialist. Only through such a course of development with its many
forward and backward movements can the carryovers from class
society---such as commodity economy and the differences between mental
and manual labor, between industry and agriculture, and between town and
countryside---be steadily eroded and even­tually eliminated, and can the
state, in consequence, wither away. Short of effectively and ceaselessly
carrying out such a program (which provides decisive yardsticks for
evaluating the reality of socialist transition), areas of critical
weak­ness conic to the fore and the transition forward tends toward
reversal. In assessing whether a nation is on a socialist course, to
declare as primary not conformity to these yardsticks but merely some
social welfare improvements and certain modes of central planning,
inverts basic reality. This subordinates essence to appearances, what is
necessary (fundamental, law-governed proc­esses) to what is contingent,
and what is general to what is particular.

Socialism is a ceaseless revolutionary struggle. As in transitions in
nature, so long as socialism continues to exist, it remains vulnerable
to reversal; regression to a non-classic type of capitalism can occur.
Socialism is only final when it is completely surpassed.

**SOCIALISM IN THE** USSR **AND THE POST-STALIN PERIOD**

On the first anniversary of the October Revolution in 1918, Lenin made
clear the vital importance for its consolidation that socialist
revolutions also take place elsewhere and his belief that this would
occur:

> We have always realized that if we were called upon to begin the
> revolution, which grew out of the world struggle, it was not on
> account of any merit of the Russian proletariat, or because it was in
> advance of the others. On the contrary, it was only because of the
> particular weakness and backwardness of capitalism, and the particular
> pressure of military strategic circum­stances, that we were obliged by
> the course of events to occupy a position in

>
> advance of the other divisions, and to wait until they also began to
> move and rose in revolt.\'\*
>
> When the time had elapsed in which the Soviet government had endured
> for a longer time than the Paris Commune, Lenin considered this an
> enormous ac­complishment. Only later did his position shift from
> \"holding on\" until the victory of the international revolution (the
> hoped-for proletarian revolutions in certain key countries, such as
> Germany, did not materialize) to considering the feasibility of
> striving for the triumph of socialism in one country alone.
>
> Unlike the bourgeoisie, which even prior to its seizure of full state
> power had secured considerable training in the know-how of rule, the
> working class and its party arc inexperienced and arc confronted by a

and prevailing social practice, have de facto *at their disposal the
means of production and of their products* which, formally speaking,
belong to the state.\"\" (Bettelheim)

What in the main and the long run flourished was centralism and
bourgeois relations and ideology. What in the main and the long run
withered away were democratic processes and socialist relations and
ideology: (1) within the party, to the point that local and even
national party congresses, as well as meetings of the Central Committee
and to some extent the Political Bureau, at times verged on being
rituals blatantly rubberstamping decisions of the party secretariat and
its overly powerful leaders; (2) within the soviets or people\'s
congresses, which similarly tended to become sterile formalities, mere
public ceremonies; (3) within the trade unions, at production
conferences their role essentially reduced to being sycophants of
factory managers who were invested with the power to hire, fire, and
plan, and who were increasingly oriented toward max­imizing enterprise
profitability, often through speedup. Critics came to be scorned as
fools, or to be viewed as hostile opponents or, if they persisted, as
troublemakers to be silenced, while toadying, nepotism, and cliquism
were elevated as the way of wisdom.

Within the proclaimed proletarian state, the rehired personnel of the
de­stroyed czarist state, conjoined with new cadres molded in the
bourgeois world outlook and values of their mentors, carved out ever
larger niches of bureau­cratic power. Though seemingly the USSR had
smashed the feudal-bourgeois state structures, in essence the human
constituents of these vanished structures were only momentarily
dispersed, held in temporary suspension. Over time, they coalesced,
tending to become the center of gravity, more and more infusing the new
proletarian-created structures with a bourgeois content.

Lenin was well aware that the proletarian state was beleaguered, not
only from without the USSR, but even more critically from within. Early
on, in \"The Party Crisis\" (January 1921), he wrote: \"What we actually
have is a workers\' state, with this peculiarity, firstly, that it is
not the working class but the peasant population that predominates in
the country, and, secondly, that it is a workers\' state with
bureaucratic distortions.\"\"

Aware that the bureaucracy increasingly dominated the party, Lenin a
year later in his report to the Eleventh Party Congress (March 27, 1922)
\"used the metaphor of \'the man at the steering wheel,\' meaning the
ruling party in charge of the state. The state machine, he said, \'did
not operate in the way we wanted. How did it operate? The machine
refused to obey the hand that guided it. It was like a car that was
going not in the direction the driver desired, but in the direction
someone else desired. . . As Lenin made clear, this \'someone else\' was
the capitalists, the speculators, and the administrative apparatus which
was under the influence of the bourgeoisie and tending to become
\'independent\' of the proletarian dictatorship.\"\"

Addressing the Fourth Congress of the Communist International at the end
of 1922, Lenin declared: \"We took over the old machinery of state, and
that was our misfortune . . . there arc hundreds of thousands of old
officials whom we got from the Tsar and from bourgeois society and who,

stead, eventually the Party explicitly maintained that the
economic-political process could be controlled from on top rather than
from below, that the Soviet government was able \"to control production,
exchange, and prices by means of economic and administrative measures. .
. .\"\" (BetteIheim)\*

Similarly, on the basis of this rationale of priorities, the Soviet
party relied mainly on enforced collectivization and on providing
tractors and other farm equipment to raise peasant productivity and
consciousness. This contrasted with primarily (but not solely) relying
on persuasion and ideological remolding and the active involvement of
the masses in struggling for a socialist cultural revolution\*\* and
opposing bourgeois ideology and practices which, for example, sustained
or increased the disparity between mental and manual labor and town and
countryside. Persuasion, ideological remolding, and mass involvement are
key means to strengthen socialist relations and consciousness and
thereby open the door to increased productivity, using higher
technology. Stalin, expressing the prevailing party belief, declared
(1931) that \"technique decides every­thing,\" rather than, first and
foremost, struggle in the sphere of ideology and class relations, a
struggle inseparable from and coordinated with improving technique.
\"The distinguishing feature\" of the mode of achieving peasant
collec­tivization was proudly proclaimed to be \"the revolution. . . .
*from above.\"\" Yet* the proletarian state is based mainly on voluntary
agreement between the work­ers and peasantry. \"Our Party,\" Lenin
stressed, \"relies on two classes and therefore its instability would be
possible and its downfall inevitable if there were no agreement between
these two classes.\"\" Even in the midst of the civil war and war
communism Lenin warned that \"coercion applied to the middle peasants
would cause untold harm. . . . *Here coercion would ruin the whole
cause.\"*

Ideology and class relations constitute an ensemble. So lOng as the
bourgeois credo of each person for himself/herself and devil take the
hindmost is fos­tered---instead by being supplanted by the
socialist-oriented outlook of all workers for one and one for
all---there is in the last analysis no basic way for production to
increase other than by material incentives and enterprise profitability
becoming the centerpiece of economic planning. Modernization and rising
living standards effected on such an economic basis increasingly produce
bourgeois, not socialist, ideology and relations.

Ideology\*\*\* is a key sphere of class struggle, and theory is a key
component. So much is this so that \"without a revolutionary theory
there can be no revolu­tionary movement.\"\" (Lenin) The history of
Marxist-Leninist ideology is a history of the contradictory currents
involved in its formation, and especially of their transformation
(including shifts in the relations of domination and subor­dination), and
of the interaction of ideology with class relations and class strug-

(precisely among the peasants as the overwhelming majority of the
population) that this entire reorganization in cooperatives is
impossible without a cultural revolution\" (\"On Cooperation,\"

and agricultural branches and tied the salaries of local party officials
to the \"economic success indicators\" of the factories and farms they
supervised. This thrust party officials into the profitability race, as
well as pitted workers and farmers against each other.

Kosygin, Khrushchev\'s successor as premier, in September 1965 proposed,
both for consumer goods and for means of production, that \"in order to
orien­tate the enterprise toward raising efficiency, it is best to use
the profit index, the index of profitability.\"\" This will encourage
enterprises to \"search for ways of increasing labor productivity.\"
Also, \"it is necessary to leave to the enterprises more of their
profits,\" and for them to set up a \"material incentives fund.\"\" From
the outset managerial personnel siphoned off for themselves more than 45
percent of the funds provided for \"material incentives.\" (Kaledinova
and Tomsky) Central industrial ministries were reestablished, now geared
to max­imizing profits. Khachaturov, a key Soviet economist, wrote that
in deciding on investments \"to make for expanding and technically
improving production, . . of all the alternatives, an enterprise will
choose one that provides for the biggest rise in profitability.\"\" By
the end of 1970 the new system embraced industrial enterprises producing
about 92 percent of all industrial output and contributing over 95
percent of the total profits realized by industry.\" (Drogishinsky)

By 1973 \"production associations\"---the grouping together of
enterprises making similar products---authorized experimentally in the
1965 package of \"reforms\" were made compulsory and they quickly
proliferated. In addition to the \"industrial associations,
agrarian-industrial, scientific-industrial and indus­trial-commercial
complexes\" were set up.\' (Gubin) Free competition inau­gurated in 1965
was soon supplanted within the USSR by monopoly, by the contention among
industrial giants.

Monopoly has its social counterpart in polarization. Shortly before his
death, Soviet economist Eugene Varga deplored \"the contrast between the
excessive material well-being of the ruling aristocracy and the
extremely low wages of the majority of the workers, employees and
collective farmers.\"

As regards economic, political, and philosophical departures from
Marxist-Leninist economic and political theory, as well as philosophy,
Bettelhcim shows that since the ensconcing of the intelligentsia in the
machinery of state

> took place without the intelligentsia having been ideologically
> transformed, and without this machinery having been revolutionized,
> the overwhelming majority of the intellectuals functioned as agents of
> bourgeois practices, both on the plane of management of enterprises
> and on that of teaching, scientific and technological research, art,
> and literature. . . . What was needed here was a struggle to transform
> the ideological apparatuses and *against the separation between mental
> and manual* work---and this struggle was not undertaken.\"

This is but one of a spectrum of acts of omission and of commission
which provoke the question whether they arose from chance, from
thoughtless but remediable oversight, or whether throughout there is
present an underlying adverse, inevitable, necessary, law-governed
relationship.

**among the Chinese people had a counterpart within the party itself
from the time of its founding, an illicit but unavoidable coalition
between two groups: (1) bourgeois democrats who proclaimed their fealty
to communism but actually sought only to end feudalism and foreign
domination and then to establish capitalism, and (2) communists who
sought to continue the revolutionary ad­vance and build socialism. By
dint of their long and active involvement in the party, the first group
(the bourgeois democrats) held many leading and inter­mediate posts and
did not have to infiltrate the party (as in the USSR) after the working
class, in alliance with the peasantry, won state power. They con­stituted
a top leadership core and provided rightist spearheads, persons in
prominent posts who struggled to weaken socialist, and strengthen
bourgeois economic and political relations, psychology and ideology,
and---especially at critical junctures in socialism\'s advance---tried
to overthrow socialism.**

**These junctures were principally the party rectification campaign
(Yan\'an) in 1942, the Great Leap Forward in 1958, and the Great
Proletarian Cultural Revolution launched in 1966. The contention between
two opposite lines of development pervades these upsurges. These surges
forward arc linked and have as their outcome the arrest of the \"gang of
four\" and developments since then. Both because these events are
sequential and their nature is hotly dis­puted, the exposition in this
section endeavors to combine a narrative form with an analysis showing
the inner dynamics of these two lines of development, the necessary
course of events in the struggle between the contending forces.**

**Having only a minimal development of industry, especially heavy
industry, and with the social center of gravity very heavily weighted on
the side of a newly liberated, formerly semifeudal peasantry, it was
patent that, in setting forth on a socialist course, the PRC confronted
problems in some respects even more extreme than those of the USSR at
the conclusion of its civil war. On the other hand, the Communist Party
of China had the benefit of Soviet experience and also of their own,
albeit essentially bourgeois-democratic, in governing liberated areas
prior to 1949. Moreover, at the outset the USSR provided considerable
material assistance.**

**The number of long-time party members amid China\'s 475 millions in
1949 was even more disproportionate than in the Soviet Union in 1920 at
the conclu­sion of the civil war and imperialist intervention. In China
in 1935, during the Long March and at a critical juncture in party
policy when Mao\'s leading position was established, membership had
fallen to about 40,000. By 1945 the membership figure had risen to
1,250,000 and by 1949 to 4,400,000. There were about 4,000,000 workers
in 1949, largely in light industry. Only a rela­tively small number of
workers were party members, the cities having been controlled by the
Guomindang until practically the end of the civil war. By 1957 party
membership had almost tripled. The then 12,720,000 members were composed
of 8,500,000 peasants, 1,880,000 intellectuals, 1,740,000 workers, and
600,000 with other social backgrounds---this in a nation of 600
million.**

**Mao was well aware of Lenin\'s warning that \"small production
*engenders* capitalism and the bourgeoisie continuously, daily, hourly,
spontaneously, and on a mass scale.\" This process tends to reinforce
the ambivalence inherent in endeavoring to remold bourgeois
intellectuals along socialist lines while at the**

and aggressively unreconciled to the loss of their privileged position.
Bitterly hostile to a rectification-reeducation campaign against the
rightists then under way (1957), many of the intellectuals and many of
the bourgeoisie, Mao wrote, \"are mortally afraid of remoulding, saying
that it gives rise to an . . . \'inferiority complex\' . . . on the
contrary they want to remould the proletariat . . . to transform the
world in the image of the bourgeoisie. . . .\"^16^ Occupying many key
posts and existing in every city, the rightists utilized the party
policy in the arts---\"Let a Hundred Flowers Blossom, Let a Hundred
Schools of Thought Contend\"---to mount \"wild attacks against the
working class and the Commu­nist Party in an attempt to overthrow the
state power led by the working class. . . .\"^4^\' (Mao)

Each level of society affords a distinctive outreach to the arts. The
regression of society is also the recession of art, its stepping back
toward a prior social level. Exploitation and serving self as contrasted
with nonexploitation and serv­ing the people have their artistic
counterparts. In furthering the regression of socialism to capitalism,
art serves not art but reactionary politics.

An intense political and ideological struggle ensued but no heads
rolled. The outcome of \"airing views fully, holding great debates and
writing big-character posters\"---the new form of the rectification
movement \"created by the masses\"---showed that \"90 percent of our
entire population arc for socialism.\" (Mao) For the future, Mao urged
that \"rectification should, in general, be con­ducted once a year. . .
.\"^49^ He stressed that \"the intellectuals are reluctant to accept
Marxism-Leninism\" and that \"the proletariat must build up its own army
of intellectuals, just as the bourgeoisie does.\"

Despite these emphases and efforts of \\lao (and all those who supported
a socialist course) which plainly required considerable time for their
successful fruition, in the period from 1958 to 1966 rightist influence
became more perva­sive in the top echelons and in many intermediate
levels of the party and the state, as well as in educational and other
institutions, but this time, forewarned, proceeding more stealthily, on
cat\'s feet, and not prematurely with an all-out frontal assault as in
1957-1958.

Socialism, from its inception, is in a race, a total conflict, with
counterrevolu­tion in its efforts to restore capitalism. Socialism
necessarily struggles to lessen the prevalence of and eventually
eliminate, *inter alia,* bourgeois right (for in­stance, the eight level
wage system), commodity exchange, small-scale pro­duction, the \"three
major differences,\" an educational system structured in key respects
along bourgeois lines and largely administered by a bourgeois-oriented
intelligentsia, and a deeply ingrained feudal ideology. All these
aspects in their growth and synergistic interaction continually
replenished and rein­forced the ranks of those seeking to develop
capitalism in China.\* The central target of their periodic power plays
was the party and in this effort they had an additional, historic
advantage, the long period before **1949** during which they had become
deeply entrenched in the party and well-trained in intrigue. In 1959

\*In the pre-1949 period China was semifeudal-semicolonial. Thus, the
bourgeois goal of the rightists was not a restoration of capitalism, but
its institution for the first time, since, in the main, after 1949 and
up to 1976 the PRC\'s socialist course bypassed a capitalist period of
development.

Among the major reasons the differences epitomized in the divergent
views of Mao and Liu came to a head in 1966 were

By mid-1966 the infiltration into leading positions in the party of
bourgeois-oriented cadres had reached a critical point. Deng Do, a
leading official of the Peking party committee, threw down the gauntlet.
In his diatribe *Amnesia* he declared, using an only slightly veiled
reference, that Mao failed to realize that the Great Leap Forward was a
catastrophe and persisted in imposing his \"gen­eral line of socialist
construction\" on an opposed and exhausted populace. \"Such a person,\"
said Deng Do, \"must promptly take a complete rest, must not talk or do
anything.\" If Mao did not heed this advice, then the therapy should be
\"hitting the patient over the head with a special club to induce a
state of shock. \'^7^

bodyguard and immediately dubbed the \"gang of four.\"\* Instead of
allowing the political question of the successor to Mao to be discussed
and voted on at the next day\'s plenary meeting, the Central Committee
on October 7 was con­fronted by a military fait accompli, which pointedly
warned other dissident top functionaries of the consequences of
opposition. This was an action without parallel in the party\'s
resolution of its schisms. In seizing political power, they also seized
greater control of the armed forces. Deng and his supporters were well
aware of the truth of Mao\'s dictum: \"According to the Marxist theory
of the state, the army is the chief component of state power.\"\"

The scenario was much like Khruschey\'s in the Soviet Union. Utilizing
supporters in the party, the army, and the bureaucracy, and among
industrial enterprise directors, in a takeover effected with military
assistance, Deng and his adherents easily silenced Mao\'s adherents in
the party leadership, including the \"gang of four.\" In taking power,
Deng\'s group claimed legitimacy on the basis of Mao saying before he
died that with Elua Guofeng \"in charge I am at case.\" But this saying
(assuming its authenticity and context) provided no man­date for escaping
a crucial debate by arresting party opponents. It became increasingly
clear that those who took power in October 1976 had since 1952 (when the
PRC\'s socialist measures mainly commenced) felt increasingly ill at
ease, a hostile feeling rendered acute by the Cultural Revolution.
Throughout this period Deng and his associates were in fundamental
opposition to Mao\'s socialist course\_

After their coup they declared that as of 1957-1958 practically all
bourgeois intellectuals had been remolded and had become part of the
working class, that from then on they had supported socialism, and that
class struggle had ceased to be the \"key link.\" This served to hide
from the masses that the actuality regard­ing the intellectuals and the
class struggle was the exact opposite. Instead of having been remolded,
a core group of bourgeois intellectuals in key positions had seized
power and intensified the class struggle.

Having publicly relegated class struggle to a minor role, they asserted
that socialist relations already prevailed, so that the central dynamic
had become the struggle for economic-technological \"modernization,\"
the contradiction be­tween the PRC\'s low level of production and the
people\'s need for an advanced level of production. This helped clear
the way for going ahead with a capitalist mode of modernization under
the guise of building socialism. The Great Prole­tarian Culture
Revolution was declared to have been a basic error. Practically en masse
those castigated as rightists were soon rehabilitated as having been
wrongly calumniated and then were elevated to key posts in the party,
the bureaucracy, and other institutions. By July 1977 Deng had been
restored to all

\*One of the four was Jiang Qing, the minister of culture and Mao\'s
wife. The other three occupied the top editorial posts in three key
party organs: *Hongqi* (Red Flag), *Renmin Riboo* (Peoples Daily), and
f*iefangjin Bao* (Liberation Daily). All four had strongly opposed
revisionism in the party and denounced Deng as bourgeois-oriented and
had been backed by Mao. \"Gang of four\" is a formulation plucked from
the bourgeois lexicon that bypasses and obscures a political
characteriza­tion, such as \"leftist\" or \"rightist.\" Nor were the four
the only ones arrested. The actuality was nor a conspiracy of four
individuals but of a rightist group who tagged a conspiracy label on
their opponents, the better to conceal a bourgeois seizure of power, the
beginning of a full-scale overturn of socialism in the PRC.

Such \"leases,\" often for fifteen years or longer,\"= arc a fig leaf
for title deeds. What has been the effect on the mass of people of the
responsibility system?

There is no limit on earnings and some peasants already garner over
100,000 yuan (US \$50,000) a year. Peasant households making an income
of RN113 10,000\* arc no longer the rare cases they were a year or two
ago. This rapidly developing polarization has not led to any
governmental policy change to slow down or reverse the direction. On the
contrary, \"profit is no longer a dirty word in China . . . \[despite
the \"uneven\" conditions\] the policy of encouraging a minority of the
peasantry to \'get rich\' first has been kept on course.\"\'\"

And 'vho are the vanguard of the get-rich-quick brigade? An
investigation found that

Concomitant with the growth in commodity relations and material
incentives since the 1979 \"reforms\" were launched has been the growth
in corruption:

This contamination involves \"some Party members, cadres and even some
lead­ing cadres. . . .\"\" The scope of this plague exceeds even that of
the one inherited by the People\'s Republic of China at its 1949
inception:

called \"yuan.\" RNIB10,000 = \$3,134 (as of January 1, 1986). The *New

as individual ownership of basic means of production, hitherto deemed
indis­pensable for a society to be deemed capitalist; and (2) in the PRC,
with its less developed economy, some features of continuing
state-capitalist monopoly arc blatantly combined with classic capitalist
components of growth of a substan­tial, petty bourgeois-bourgeois
ownership base in certain means of production.

This regression of socialism in the USSR and the PRC raises the question
whether socialism in these countries was a premature implant, an
incorrect course for Marxist-Leninists to take. The question remains
legitimate even though---for opposite reasons---such an assessment
regarding the PRC would partly coincide with that of Deng and his
associates who, from the beginning in October 1949 intensified their
efforts to establish capitalism in China.

The fact that counterrevolution sooner or later necessarily prevailed in
those countries does not mean that capitalism was necessary from the
inception of their transition from semifeudal-semicolonial status, that
such countries must first undergo capitalism before they have socialism,
and thus that embarking on a socialist course was an error. Whatever the
varieties in modes and in range of regression to capitalism in these
countries, the presocialist world cannot be recreated. That world is
gone, never to return. Socialist revolutions have basi­cally and
unalterably affected society\'s course and tempo, preparing, even in
reversal, major forward steps, and at an accelerated rate. For example,
in chal­lenging idealism and metaphysics, as well as simplistic ideas of
socialist transi­tion without major forward and backward movements or
even fundamental reversals of direction, this present regression to a
kind of capitalism, this nega­tive with its sharpening of antagonisms, is
not a blind alley but a stage, a connection that eventually leads to a
basic positive. Leaving aside those who declare that the USSR and/or the
PRC arc presently socialist---some saying that either or both are good
and some that either or both are bad---still others equate noncompletion
of socialism, its overthrow, in these countries to its failure. In
truth, there has been a failure. What has failed and been refuted is not
socialism in semifeudal-semicolonial countries and least of all
socialism as such, but only an abstract, metaphysical notion of
socialism---an illusory, impatient, one-step, straight-road movement,
rather than one with twists and turns and reverses that eventually
approximates a spiral movement forward, a dialectical process.

For those striving to move society forward, at bottom what is waning arc
illusions and weaknesses, and what is also diminishing arc
imperialism\'s mate­rial and ideological resources, and what is arising
is augmented, more precise revolutionary knowledge and firmer
determination, the precondition and pre­lude to much greater strength.
Progress at times, Lenin noted, consists not so much in the achievement
of positive gains but rather in emancipation from harmful illusions.
However distorted or finally lifeless socialism has become in the
practices of certain governments professedly socialist and certain
communist parties, capitalist society\'s accelerating signs of decay
endow socialist concepts, ever more refined and developed, with
heightening vitality.

\"usurer state\"\'\" will eventually have to pay the piper in a world,
Lenin already noted some 70 years ago, \"divided into a handful of
money-lending states on the one side, and a vast majority of debtor
states on the other.\"\'\"

This increasing vulnerability, this enormous complex of intensifying
in­stabilities are, in the overall, reflected in the considerable
deepening of the four constant antagonisms of capitalist society in its
imperialist stage: between capitalists and workers, among capitalists,
between imperialists and neo-colonial/dependent peoples, and among
imperialists of different countries. Pressed by the sharpening
antagonisms, on every continent, more in the periph­ery but in the
heartland as well, masses of people arc moving toward the left, however
much as yet unevenly, obscurely and minimally. In the present period
each imperialist \"victory\" over a people uses up economic and
political reserves, leaving the imperialist system weaker. Imperialism
in endeavoring to resolve its antagonisms only sets the stage for their
intensification.

Far from having become outdated by much vaunted assertions of American
exceptionalism, Lenin\'s characterizations of imperialism retain their
crucial ac­curacy: as the stage of \"monopoly-capitalism,\"\'\" as
\"parasitic or decaying capitalism,\"\'\" as \"politically in general a
striving toward violence and reac­tion.\"\'\" What are these present
signs but of imperialism\'s ill-health, that im­perialism \"is the
transition from the capitalist system to a higher social order.\"\'\"
Capitalism\'s world-wide deadend is socialism\'s world-wide antechamber.

The conditions are being assembled for the permanent passage of
society\'s forward-moving forces, erratically and in cataclysmic pain,
beyond history\'s great divide, from class to classless society.\* The
transition of primitive com­munal society to class society\'s first form,
slavery, was consummated in the course of protracted civil wars in which
primitive communal society was de­stroyed and class society constructed.
In reverse, the transition from class soci­ety\'s final form,
imperialism, to modern classless society may involve protracted civil
wars in the course of which class society will be destroyed and modern
classless society constructed, a negation of negation: \"In the long run
the prob­lems of social life are decided by the class struggle in its
bitterest and acutest form, the form of civil war.\"^12^\"

It is a befitting final irony of capitalist society that the principal
adversaries, contending seemingly for mastery but actually for mutual
oblivion, are classi­cally evolved capitalism and a regressed socialism.
As in the prescient Greek legend of early class society\', from the
field of social development sown with dragon\'s teeth have sprung the
prime contending warriors of this society\'s final internecine carnage.
Equally, these events foreshadow the intervention of the peoples of the
world, above all of the working class and of truly Marxist---Leninist
parties, in shaping history\'s forward course.

its very reason for existence, is my belief (however unproved) that,
come what may, much of humanity will survive the conflicts ahead and
that a higher, **a** communist society will eventually prevail on a
world scale.

Dialectical *Materialism* is particularly noteworthy for the breadth of
its coverage, the clarity of its presentation and a wide assortment of
piquant quotations. I suspect that many ordinary people (and who isn\'t
one?) will find this direct, highly systematic but still earthy approach
to explaining dialectics more effective than the more stylized and
convoluted accounts that are coming in ever greater numbers out of the
academy. Ira Gollobin\'s Dialectical *Materialism* is a book that
warrants our most serious attention.

Ira Gollobin has written a clear, comprehensive, and politically
relevant explication of dialectical materialism as a philosophy, a
theory of nature, and a dynamic theory of societal development. . . .
The book is en­cyclopedic in scope and sensitive torthe range of
intellectual and practical problems that are proper tests of the
validity and power of dialectical materialism. In this sense, it fills a
gap in the American literature.

It is a wise book. It is also the first book known to me in which the
practice of wisdom emerges with clarity from the principles of
dialectical mate­rialism. These principles are developed with a wealth of
historical exam­ples, and with a historical appreciation of the class
basis of philosophy.

Mr. Gollobin\'s most substantive contribution is his extensive attempt
to develop the dialectics of the subject, to develop an epistemology
ade­quate to Marxist philosophy. . . *Dialectical Materialism* will be
helpful to all people who care about human progress.
